The architecture for **AWS Transfer Family (SFTP)** inside a **VPC** with **CloudWatch logging** and **Amazon S3** storage consists of several interconnected functional components. Here's a detailed breakdown of each:

---

## üß© Functional Components Overview

### 1. **SFTP Users**

* **What they are**: End-users (internal or external) who use SFTP clients like FileZilla, WinSCP, or CLI to upload/download files.
* **Authentication**: Managed via SSH public keys (service-managed) or optionally via custom identity providers (like Active Directory or Cognito).
* **Role**:

  * Authenticate using SSH key
  * Transfer files over SFTP
  * Interact only with their own S3 folder

---

### 2. **AWS Transfer Family (SFTP Server)**

* **Service**: Fully managed SFTP endpoint provided by AWS.
* **Hosting**: Deployed inside a **VPC** with private IPs (via VPC Endpoint).
* **Protocol**: SFTP (optionally also FTPS, FTP)
* **Key functions**:

  * Acts as the **bridge** between users and backend storage (S3)
  * Handles **authentication and routing** to user-specific folders
  * Integrates with **CloudWatch** for logging
  * Associates each user with an **IAM role** for access control
  * Maps each user to a **home directory** in S3

---

### 3. **Amazon S3 (Storage Backend)**

* **Purpose**: Destination for all uploaded/downloaded files.
* **Structure**:

  * Common bucket, e.g. `my-company-sftp-bucket`
  * Folder per user: `/home/user1/`, `/home/user2/`, etc.
* **Access Control**:

  * Controlled by IAM role policies assigned to the user
  * Enforced directory access restrictions (chroot-like behavior)
* **Benefits**:

  * Highly durable and available
  * Scalable for growing data
  * Event-driven integrations possible (e.g., Lambda triggers)

---

### 4. **CloudWatch Logs**

* **Purpose**: Captures SFTP session activities like:

  * Login attempts
  * File uploads/downloads
  * Errors
* **Implementation**:

  * AWS Transfer Family sends logs via a specific **IAM logging role**
  * Logs are streamed into a specific **Log Group**: `/aws/transfer/<server-name or bucket>`
* **Use Cases**:

  * Auditing
  * Troubleshooting file access
  * Monitoring usage patterns

---

### 5. **IAM Roles**

* Two key IAM roles are required:

#### a. **Access Role (per user)**

* Used by each SFTP user to access only their designated directory
* Attached to the user via `aws_transfer_user.role`

#### b. **Logging Role**

* Grants AWS Transfer Family permission to write logs to CloudWatch
* Includes `logs:CreateLogStream` and `logs:PutLogEvents`

---

### 6. **VPC & Subnets**

* **Purpose**: Hosts the private SFTP endpoint (if endpoint\_type = VPC)
* **Requirements**:

  * VPC ID
  * At least one subnet ID in which the server will be deployed
* **Network Access**:

  * Typically combined with **VPC Endpoints** or **VPN/Direct Connect** for access
  * No public IPs unless explicitly required

---

## üîÅ End-to-End Functional Flow

1. **User** initiates SFTP session ‚Üí connects to Transfer Family endpoint.
2. AWS Transfer Family:

   * Validates SSH key
   * Maps to IAM role & S3 path
3. **User** uploads/downloads files ‚Üí directly to/from **S3**.
4. **All session logs** (e.g., login, file transfer) sent to **CloudWatch Logs**.
5. Optional: You can extend with **Lambda**, **SNS**, or **Step Functions** for event-driven automation.
