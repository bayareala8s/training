The architecture for **AWS Transfer Family (SFTP)** inside a **VPC** with **CloudWatch logging** and **Amazon S3** storage consists of several interconnected functional components. Here's a detailed breakdown of each:

---

## 🧩 Functional Components Overview

### 1. **SFTP Users**

* **What they are**: End-users (internal or external) who use SFTP clients like FileZilla, WinSCP, or CLI to upload/download files.
* **Authentication**: Managed via SSH public keys (service-managed) or optionally via custom identity providers (like Active Directory or Cognito).
* **Role**:

  * Authenticate using SSH key
  * Transfer files over SFTP
  * Interact only with their own S3 folder

---

### 2. **AWS Transfer Family (SFTP Server)**

* **Service**: Fully managed SFTP endpoint provided by AWS.
* **Hosting**: Deployed inside a **VPC** with private IPs (via VPC Endpoint).
* **Protocol**: SFTP (optionally also FTPS, FTP)
* **Key functions**:

  * Acts as the **bridge** between users and backend storage (S3)
  * Handles **authentication and routing** to user-specific folders
  * Integrates with **CloudWatch** for logging
  * Associates each user with an **IAM role** for access control
  * Maps each user to a **home directory** in S3

---

### 3. **Amazon S3 (Storage Backend)**

* **Purpose**: Destination for all uploaded/downloaded files.
* **Structure**:

  * Common bucket, e.g. `my-company-sftp-bucket`
  * Folder per user: `/home/user1/`, `/home/user2/`, etc.
* **Access Control**:

  * Controlled by IAM role policies assigned to the user
  * Enforced directory access restrictions (chroot-like behavior)
* **Benefits**:

  * Highly durable and available
  * Scalable for growing data
  * Event-driven integrations possible (e.g., Lambda triggers)

---

### 4. **CloudWatch Logs**

* **Purpose**: Captures SFTP session activities like:

  * Login attempts
  * File uploads/downloads
  * Errors
* **Implementation**:

  * AWS Transfer Family sends logs via a specific **IAM logging role**
  * Logs are streamed into a specific **Log Group**: `/aws/transfer/<server-name or bucket>`
* **Use Cases**:

  * Auditing
  * Troubleshooting file access
  * Monitoring usage patterns

---

### 5. **IAM Roles**

* Two key IAM roles are required:

#### a. **Access Role (per user)**

* Used by each SFTP user to access only their designated directory
* Attached to the user via `aws_transfer_user.role`

#### b. **Logging Role**

* Grants AWS Transfer Family permission to write logs to CloudWatch
* Includes `logs:CreateLogStream` and `logs:PutLogEvents`

---

### 6. **VPC & Subnets**

* **Purpose**: Hosts the private SFTP endpoint (if endpoint\_type = VPC)
* **Requirements**:

  * VPC ID
  * At least one subnet ID in which the server will be deployed
* **Network Access**:

  * Typically combined with **VPC Endpoints** or **VPN/Direct Connect** for access
  * No public IPs unless explicitly required

---

## 🔁 End-to-End Functional Flow

1. **User** initiates SFTP session → connects to Transfer Family endpoint.
2. AWS Transfer Family:

   * Validates SSH key
   * Maps to IAM role & S3 path
3. **User** uploads/downloads files → directly to/from **S3**.
4. **All session logs** (e.g., login, file transfer) sent to **CloudWatch Logs**.
5. Optional: You can extend with **Lambda**, **SNS**, or **Step Functions** for event-driven automation.

=============================================================================



Here is a **detailed step-by-step guide** to understand and implement the **entire automated file transfer workflow using AWS S3, EventBridge, Step Functions, and Lambda**. This guide explains each part of the pipeline from file upload to automated transfer and monitoring.

---

## 🎯 **Goal**

Automatically transfer files uploaded to a **source S3 bucket** into a **destination S3 bucket** using:

* ✅ **Amazon S3** – Object storage
* ✅ **Amazon EventBridge** – Trigger mechanism
* ✅ **AWS Step Functions** – Orchestration engine
* ✅ **AWS Lambda** – File processing logic

---

## 🧩 COMPONENTS & RESPONSIBILITIES

| Component             | Role                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source S3 Bucket      | File upload location by customer or external system           |
| EventBridge Rule      | Detects new file (`ObjectCreated`) and triggers Step Function |
| Step Function         | Executes a workflow to orchestrate file processing            |
| Lambda Function       | Copies the file from source bucket to destination bucket      |
| Destination S3 Bucket | Final location where files are delivered                      |

---

## 🔁 **STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW**

---

### ✅ Step 1: **User or System Uploads File to Source S3 Bucket**

* Customer uploads a file using SFTP or via application directly to the **source S3 bucket**.
* Example: `my-source-sftp-bucket/sample/customer1/data.csv`

---

### ✅ Step 2: **EventBridge Detects New File Upload**

* An **Amazon EventBridge rule** is configured to listen for `ObjectCreated` events on the source bucket.
* When the event is detected, EventBridge triggers the next step (Step Function execution).

```json
{
  "source": ["aws.s3"],
  "detail-type": ["Object Created"],
  "detail": {
    "bucket": {
      "name": ["my-source-sftp-bucket"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: **EventBridge Starts Step Function Workflow**

* The rule passes required details to Step Function:

  * `source_bucket`
  * `destination_bucket`
  * `key` (file path)

```json
{
  "source_bucket": "my-source-sftp-bucket",
  "destination_bucket": "my-destination-bucket",
  "key": "sample/customer1/data.csv"
}
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: **Step Function Invokes Lambda**

* The **Step Function state machine** has one state called `TransferFile` which is a `Task` state.
* It invokes the Lambda function and passes it the input from EventBridge.

---

### ✅ Step 5: **Lambda Function Transfers the File**

* The Lambda function receives the input and executes `s3.copy_object()` to copy the file.
* It moves the file from the source bucket to the destination bucket using the same key.

```python
s3.copy_object(
  Bucket=destination_bucket,
  Key=key,
  CopySource={"Bucket": source_bucket, "Key": key}
)
```

* Output:

```json
{
  "status": "Success",
  "message": "File sample/customer1/data.csv copied successfully"
}
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: **Monitoring & Logging**

* **CloudWatch Logs** capture logs from:

  * Lambda function execution
  * Step Function execution state (succeeded, failed)
* You can view:

  * File name, transfer status
  * Error messages in case of failure

---

## 🧪 Testing the Flow

1. Go to the **AWS S3 Console**
2. Upload a file to `my-source-sftp-bucket/sample/data.csv`
3. Go to **Step Functions Console** → Check execution status
4. Check the destination bucket: `my-destination-bucket/sample/data.csv`

---

## 📉 Diagrammatic Workflow

```
SFTP User → Source S3 Bucket
                   ↓
     [ObjectCreated Event]
                   ↓
         EventBridge Rule
                   ↓
         Step Function Started
                   ↓
         Lambda Copies the File
                   ↓
        Destination S3 Bucket ✅
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup (Terraform)

```bash
terraform destroy
```

This will remove:

* S3 buckets
* Lambda function
* IAM roles
* Step Function
* EventBridge rule and target

---

## ✅ Use Cases

* **Customer file onboarding automation**
* **Batch ingestion pipelines**
* **ETL pre-processing trigger**
* **Cross-account file transfer via automation**

---

Here is a detailed breakdown of **each component** involved in the architecture for **automated file transfer using AWS S3, Lambda, Step Functions, and EventBridge**.

---

## 🔷 1. **Source S3 Bucket**

### 🔹 Purpose:

* Acts as the **entry point** for incoming files (uploaded manually or via SFTP/AWS Transfer Family).

### 🔹 Key Characteristics:

* Can be accessed via SFTP, CLI, SDK, or AWS Console.
* Bucket is monitored for `ObjectCreated` events.
* Folder structure can be organized per customer or per file type.

### 🔹 Example:

```
Bucket name: my-source-sftp-bucket
Object key:  customer1/input/file1.csv
```

---

## 🔷 2. **Amazon EventBridge**

### 🔹 Purpose:

* Detects when a new file is uploaded to the source S3 bucket and triggers an action.

### 🔹 Event Type:

* `s3:ObjectCreated:*`

### 🔹 How it Works:

* EventBridge receives an S3 event.
* It **matches** it to a rule targeting the file upload event.
* Then it **triggers a Step Function** execution.

### 🔹 Example Event Rule Pattern:

```json
{
  "source": ["aws.s3"],
  "detail-type": ["Object Created"],
  "detail": {
    "bucket": {
      "name": ["my-source-sftp-bucket"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🔷 3. **AWS Step Functions**

### 🔹 Purpose:

* **Orchestrates** the workflow that handles file transfer.

### 🔹 What it Does:

* Receives input from EventBridge:

  ```json
  {
    "source_bucket": "my-source-sftp-bucket",
    "destination_bucket": "my-destination-bucket",
    "key": "customer1/input/file1.csv"
  }
  ```
* Invokes a Lambda function with that input.
* Handles retries and failure logic (can be extended with more steps).

### 🔹 Execution Role:

* A dedicated IAM role grants Step Functions the right to invoke Lambda.

---

## 🔷 4. **AWS Lambda Function**

### 🔹 Purpose:

* **Performs the actual file transfer** by copying an object from the source bucket to the destination bucket.

### 🔹 Code Logic:

```python
s3.copy_object(
  Bucket=destination_bucket,
  Key=key,
  CopySource={'Bucket': source_bucket, 'Key': key}
)
```

### 🔹 Input from Step Function:

* JSON payload containing `source_bucket`, `destination_bucket`, and `key`.

### 🔹 Output:

```json
{
  "status": "Success",
  "message": "File copied successfully"
}
```

### 🔹 IAM Permissions:

* Read from `source_bucket`
* Write to `destination_bucket`
* Write logs to CloudWatch

---

## 🔷 5. **Destination S3 Bucket**

### 🔹 Purpose:

* Final **landing zone** for processed/transferred files.

### 🔹 Usage:

* Files stored here can be:

  * Further processed by downstream ETL pipelines
  * Downloaded by customers
  * Trigger notifications or analytics jobs

### 🔹 Organization:

* Same key structure is preserved:

  ```
  source: customer1/input/file1.csv
  destination: customer1/input/file1.csv
  ```

---

## 🔷 6. **CloudWatch Logs (Implicit Component)**

### 🔹 Purpose:

* Used for **monitoring, debugging, and auditing**.

### 🔹 What is Logged:

* Lambda execution logs (including success/failure, exception traces)
* Step Function state transitions
