**📢 Team – Review & Vote: AWS File Transfer Architecture Alignment**

Hi everyone,

As part of our architecture review for the proposed AWS File Transfer solution, I’ve compiled a **detailed comparison matrix** that outlines the **Current State**, **AWS Proposal**, and our **Future-State Vision** across critical architecture layers (e.g., onboarding, automation, logging, scalability, etc.).

🔍 **Action Required:**
Please review the matrix and provide:

* ✅ A quick **vote** (👍 / 👎 / ❓) on each row
* 📝 Any **feedback, concerns, or suggestions**
* 🧑‍💻 Your **name** for traceability

📄 \[Link to the Review Matrix – Please Complete by *<insert deadline>*]

This feedback is key to ensuring that we’re aligned not just on the proposed architecture, but also on how it fits into our **longer-term vision for self-service and automation** in file transfers.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like a working session.

Thanks,
*Himanshu*
