## Self-Serve Backend – Platform Overview

### Purpose

The **Self-Serve Backend** is a secure, policy-driven automation layer that enables internal teams and approved customers to **request, validate, provision, and operate file-transfer workflows** without manual engineering involvement—while maintaining **strong governance, auditability, and operational controls**.

---

### What the Backend Enables

* **On-demand onboarding** of file-transfer workflows through structured inputs (JSON / form-driven)
* **Standardized execution** of pre-approved transfer patterns (e.g., SFTP↔S3, S3↔S3)
* **Environment isolation** (Dev / Test / Prod)
* **Full audit trail** for compliance, security, and operational review

---

### Core Backend Capabilities

#### 1. Policy-Controlled Workflow Orchestration

* Only **predefined, approved workflow types** can be executed
* Guardrails enforce:

  * Approved endpoints
  * Encryption requirements
  * Retry / timeout limits
  * Naming conventions
* Prevents ad-hoc or non-compliant transfers

#### 2. Secure Execution Layer

* Backend executes transfers using **service-managed identities** (no shared credentials)
* Secrets are **never exposed to users**
* Network boundaries (internal / external) are explicitly validated

#### 3. Validation & Guardrails

Every request is validated for:

* Source & target reachability
* Schema correctness
* Required fields & mandatory controls
* Environment alignment
  Invalid requests are **blocked before execution**, reducing operational risk.

#### 4. Observability & Auditability

* Every request and execution generates:

  * Request metadata
  * Execution status
  * Error details (if any)
* Logs are centrally available for:

  * SAFR audits
  * CARE operational reviews
  * Incident triage
* Enables **traceability from request → execution → outcome**

#### 5. Automated Testing & Reliability

* Backend includes **automated test scripts** that:

  * Validate connectivity
  * Exercise all supported workflow types
  * Detect failures early
* Reduces deployment and onboarding risk
