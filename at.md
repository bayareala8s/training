Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s included in the current prototype suite:

ğŸ”¹ **Login Page**
ğŸ”¹ **Sign-Up Page**
ğŸ”¹ **Customer Metadata Form**
ğŸ”¹ **Workflow Selection Page**
ğŸ”¹ **Transfer Configuration Page** (with Source, Target & Customer sections)
ğŸ”¹ **Review & Confirmation Page**
ğŸ”¹ **Success Confirmation Page**
ğŸ”¹ **Dashboard & Transfer Status Page** (includes charts and reports)
ğŸ”¹ **Clone Previous Transfers Page** (pre-fill forms from past setups)
