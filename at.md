File data staged in Amazon S3 is replicated across regions using S3 Cross-Region Replication. Replication is asynchronous, with an observed replication window of up to approximately 15 minutes. As a result, the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for staged file data is bounded at ≤15 minutes. All orchestration state, metadata, and execution ownership information is replicated synchronously using DynamoDB Global Tables and therefore has an RPO of zero.
