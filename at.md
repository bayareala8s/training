### 🔷 IV. 🔁 File Transfer Lifecycle (Slide 4)

**1. Onboarding Phase**
→ Customer uploads JSON or uses UI → Config validated → Stored in S3/DynamoDB

**2. Workflow Deployment**
→ Step Functions + Lambda deployed via Terraform
→ IAM roles generated, secrets provisioned

**3. Transfer Execution**
→ Triggered by cron/Event/S3 upload
→ Executes copy between source/target (with error handling, metadata, logging)

**4. Post-Processing & Reporting**
→ Logging in CloudWatch
→ Reports in QuickSight or Athena
→ Alerts to Slack/Teams/SNS

**5. Support & SLA**
→ Transfer history in DynamoDB
→ Re-run modules via UI/API
→ Incidents logged in ServiceNow

### 🔷 VI. 📊 Governance & SLA Strategy (Slide 6)

* **SLA**: Daily/Weekly Transfer Completion, Uptime, Error Rates
* **Governance**:

  * Config version control
  * Approved patterns (naming, encryption, etc.)
  * Audit logs + access logs for all transfers
* **Rollback**:

  * Step Function version history
  * Terraform state rollback
  * Re-run support via admin tools

---

### 🔷 VII. 📈 Scalability & Future Growth (Slide 7)

* Easily scale to 1000+ concurrent transfers via Lambda concurrency
* Support new protocols: FTPS, AS2 (via extensible protocol handler module)
* Add Machine Learning to detect anomalies (future)
* Multitenancy: customer tag-based isolation
* Cross-region transfers for DR/BC
