Hereâ€™s a **professional Microsoft Teams message** you can send to your **VP, Principal Architect, and Manager** to review the list of additional modules for the File Transfer Services architecture:

---



As part of our initiative to enhance the scalability, resilience, and governance of Group Nâ€™s File Transfer Services, Iâ€™ve compiled a comprehensive list of **additional architectural modules** that can be layered into the current design.

These modules address advanced use cases such as:

* Cross-region and cross-account transfers
* Delta-based and bulk folder ingestion
* Pre/post-transfer validations
* Reprocessing, anomaly detection, quarantine handling, and more

The goal is to **future-proof the architecture** while supporting **operational flexibility**, **compliance**, and **customer self-service**.

Iâ€™d appreciate your input on which of these we should prioritize for implementation or flag for future roadmap planning.

Let me know a good time to walk through the highlights, or Iâ€™m happy to include them in the upcoming design review.
