## Self-Serve Backend – Platform Overview

### Purpose

The **Self-Serve Backend** is a secure, policy-driven automation layer that enables internal teams and approved customers to **request, validate, provision, and operate file-transfer workflows** without manual engineering involvement—while maintaining **strong governance, auditability, and operational controls**.

---

### What the Backend Enables

* **On-demand onboarding** of file-transfer workflows through structured inputs (JSON / form-driven)
* **Standardized execution** of pre-approved transfer patterns (e.g., SFTP↔S3, S3↔S3)
* **Environment isolation** (Dev / Test / Prod)
* **Full audit trail** for compliance, security, and operational review

---

### Core Backend Capabilities

#### 1. Policy-Controlled Workflow Orchestration

* Only **predefined, approved workflow types** can be executed
* Guardrails enforce:

  * Approved endpoints
  * Encryption requirements
  * Retry / timeout limits
  * Naming conventions
* Prevents ad-hoc or non-compliant transfers

#### 2. Secure Execution Layer

* Backend executes transfers using **service-managed identities** (no shared credentials)
* Secrets are **never exposed to users**
* Network boundaries (internal / external) are explicitly validated

#### 3. Validation & Guardrails

Every request is validated for:

* Source & target reachability
* Schema correctness
* Required fields & mandatory controls
* Environment alignment
  Invalid requests are **blocked before execution**, reducing operational risk.

#### 4. Observability & Auditability

* Every request and execution generates:

  * Request metadata
  * Execution status
  * Error details (if any)
* Logs are centrally available for:

  * SAFR audits
  * CARE operational reviews
  * Incident triage
* Enables **traceability from request → execution → outcome**

#### 5. Automated Testing & Reliability

* Backend includes **automated test scripts** that:

  * Validate connectivity
  * Exercise all supported workflow types
  * Detect failures early
* Reduces deployment and onboarding risk

### Operating Model

| Area               | Model                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Request Intake     | Self-Serve (structured input) |
| Validation         | Automated + policy-driven     |
| Execution          | Fully automated               |
| Monitoring         | Centralized                   |
| Rollback           | Automated / controlled        |
| Human Intervention | Exception-only                |

---

### Key Takeaway

This Self-Serve Backend is **not a custom solution per customer**—it is a **controlled enterprise platform** that balances **speed, safety, and scale**, while meeting SAFR governance and CARE operational requirements**.

---

Below is a **clear, audit-ready response** you can provide to **SAFR / CARE**. It is written in **control language** and structured the way audit teams typically expect.

## What Audit Events Are Generated by the New Self-Serve Service?

The Self-Serve service generates **comprehensive, immutable audit events** across the **entire request-to-execution lifecycle**, ensuring full traceability, accountability, and compliance.

---

### 1. Request & Access Audit Events

Captured when a user or system initiates a self-serve request.

**Events Logged**

* Request submission timestamp
* Requestor identity (user / service role)
* Authentication method used
* Source IP / calling system
* Environment (Dev / Test / Prod)
* Workflow type requested

**Audit Purpose**

* Confirms **who initiated what and when**
* Supports access reviews and non-repudiation

---

### 2. Input Validation & Policy Enforcement Events

Captured during automated validation and guardrail checks.

**Events Logged**

* Schema validation success / failure
* Policy evaluation results (pass / block)
* Rejected fields or non-compliant parameters
* Enforcement actions taken (blocked, corrected, allowed)

**Audit Purpose**

* Demonstrates **preventive controls**
* Provides evidence that non-compliant requests cannot execute

---

### 3. Approval & Control Gate Events (If Applicable)

Captured when workflows require conditional approvals.

**Events Logged**

* Approval requested
* Approver identity
* Approval / rejection outcome
* Timestamp and justification (if required)

**Audit Purpose**

* Supports **segregation of duties**
* Enables traceability for higher-risk workflows

---

### 4. Execution & Orchestration Events

Captured during workflow execution.

**Events Logged**

* Execution start and completion times
* Execution ID (correlated to request ID)
* Source and target system identifiers
* Transfer volume and object count (metadata only)
* Execution outcome (success / failure / partial)

**Audit Purpose**

* Provides **end-to-end traceability**
* Enables operational and forensic review

---

### 5. Error, Retry & Exception Events

Captured when deviations occur.

**Events Logged**

* Failure reason and error category
* Retry attempts and outcomes
* Timeout or connectivity issues
* Escalation triggers (alerts raised)

**Audit Purpose**

* Supports incident investigations
* Demonstrates controlled failure handling

---

### 6. Security & Credential Handling Events

Captured for security-sensitive operations.

**Events Logged**

* Service role assumption events
* Credential access (token usage, not secrets)
* Encryption enforcement confirmation
* Unauthorized access attempts (if any)

**Audit Purpose**

* Confirms **no shared or exposed credentials**
* Supports security monitoring and threat detection

---

### 7. Configuration & Change Management Events

Captured when backend configuration changes occur.

**Events Logged**

* Workflow definition changes
* Policy updates
* Version changes
* Change initiator and timestamp

**Audit Purpose**

* Supports **change management controls**
* Enables rollback and historical comparison

---

### 8. Data Retention & Log Integrity Events

Captured to ensure audit durability.

**Events Logged**

* Log creation and retention confirmation
* Immutability enforcement
* Access to audit logs

**Audit Purpose**

* Ensures audit records are **tamper-resistant**
* Supports regulatory retention requirements

### Key Assurance Statement

The new Self-Serve service produces **complete, correlated, and immutable audit events** that enable SAFR and CARE teams to **reconstruct any transaction end-to-end**, from initial request through final execution outcome, without reliance on manual logs or ad-hoc evidence.

---

If you want, I can next:

* Map these audit events to **specific SAFR control IDs**
* Create a **one-page audit evidence matrix**
* Provide **sample audit log entries (sanitized)**
