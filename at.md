The proposed solution delivers several key benefits aligned with enterprise architecture principles. From a resiliency perspective, the system is designed with multi-region high availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR), enabling controlled failover behavior across regions to ensure continuity of operations. Security is implemented following Zero Trust principles, incorporating strong identity enforcement, encryption in transit and at rest, and least-privilege access controls to protect sensitive data and credentials. Reliability is achieved through idempotent execution mechanisms and distributed locking strategies that prevent duplicate file delivery and ensure consistent outcomes even under retry scenarios. The architecture is highly scalable, supporting file sizes ranging from small payloads to very large transfers with predictable performance characteristics. Operational excellence is supported through centralized logging, metrics, monitoring, documented runbooks, and defined rollback strategies to enable effective incident response and maintainability. Finally, while the solution is backend-focused, it provides self-service capabilities through APIs that allow customers to onboard SFTP and S3 endpoints and track transfer status programmatically, enabling transparency and automation without requiring a graphical interface.

The architecture is built on several key design decisions intended to balance resiliency, scalability, and operational control. First, the system adopts a partitioned active-active execution model across regions. While both regions are capable of accepting requests, execution for a given workload partition is controlled through a distributed locking mechanism implemented using Amazon DynamoDB. This ensures that only one region actively processes a specific partition at a time, preventing duplicate transfers while still enabling seamless failover and high availability.

Second, the transfer execution layer leverages AWS Fargate-based workers for SFTP operations. This approach supports streaming large files efficiently, handles retries in a controlled manner, and allows fine-grained control over network egress. By using containerized workers, the system can scale dynamically based on workload demand while maintaining isolation and predictable performance characteristics for file sizes ranging from small payloads to large multi-gigabyte transfers.

Third, Amazon S3 is used as a staging layer for SFTP-to-SFTP transfers. Introducing S3 as an intermediary storage layer improves reliability and disaster recovery by decoupling source and destination systems. It also enables operational re-drive capabilities, allowing failed transfers to be retried without requiring re-ingestion from the original source endpoint. This staging pattern enhances durability and provides greater observability into transfer state.

Fourth, the architecture follows an event-driven model. File arrival events in S3, along with scheduled triggers, initiate workflows through Amazon EventBridge and Amazon SQS, which in turn invoke AWS Step Functions for orchestration. This decoupled design promotes scalability, fault tolerance, and clear separation between event ingestion, workflow coordination, and execution.

Finally, endpoint configuration is managed programmatically through APIs. Customers register SFTP and S3 endpoints via a POST-based API interface, with credentials securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager and configuration metadata persisted in DynamoDB. This design ensures secure secret handling, consistent configuration management, and auditability, while enabling automation without requiring a graphical interface.

=======
The architecture follows a Message Orchestration Tier (MOT) design pattern, which acts as a centralized middleware layer to coordinate file transfer workflows across the enterprise. This orchestration layer decouples producers and consumers, abstracts business logic away from edge triggers, and centralizes routing, policy enforcement, retries, and state management. The MOT is implemented using AWS GovCloud managed services, primarily AWS Step Functions for workflow orchestration, Amazon EventBridge and Amazon SQS for event routing and decoupling, and AWS Lambda for lightweight routing or preprocessing logic. This pattern enables flexible, event-driven execution while maintaining governance and operational control.

The transfer execution stack leverages AWS Fargate-based workers for streaming SFTP and S3 file transfers, optimized for workloads ranging from small payloads to multi-gigabyte files. Amazon S3 serves as a durable staging layer where needed, improving reliability and enabling re-drive capabilities. Configuration metadata is stored in Amazon DynamoDB, and secrets are securely managed using AWS Secrets Manager. Security controls are enforced through fine-grained IAM policies, encryption with AWS KMS, and network isolation using VPC constructs. Together, this stack provides a scalable, resilient, and secure backend engine for enterprise file movement while preserving clear separation between orchestration, execution, and governance layers.

=====
Blast Radius refers to the scope of impact that a failure, defect, or misconfiguration can have within the system. It defines how far an incident propagates across components, services, tenants, regions, or workflows before it is contained.

For your Enterprise File Transfer Backend Engine, blast radius is intentionally minimized through architectural boundaries and isolation mechanisms:

Regional isolation ensures a failure in one region does not impact the other in the active-active deployment model.

Partitioned ownership and DynamoDB locking limit execution impact to a specific workload partition rather than the entire system.

Event-driven decoupling (EventBridge/SQS) prevents upstream or downstream services from cascading failures.

Tenant and endpoint isolation ensures one customer’s misconfiguration or failed transfer does not affect others.

Containerized Fargate workers confine execution failures to individual tasks instead of shared runtime environments.

A well-designed system intentionally constrains blast radius so that failures are localized, recoverable, and observable rather than systemic.

========
The Enterprise File Transfer Backend Engine leverages AWS-managed cryptographic services for encryption at rest and in transit. Encryption keys for Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and other managed services are maintained using AWS Key Management Service (KMS), with customer-managed keys where required by policy. Secrets such as SFTP credentials and API tokens are securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager and encrypted using KMS-backed keys. At this time, the solution does not directly integrate with the Vormetric/Thales Enterprise Key Management (EKM) platform; however, if required by Federal Reserve standards, integration options can be evaluated to align with centralized key governance policies. All key storage and cryptographic controls adhere to applicable FRISS cryptographic key management standards, including controlled access, rotation policies, logging, and least-privilege enforcement.

The platform does not require encryption keys to bootstrap or instantiate runtime services beyond AWS-managed service encryption dependencies. Key management functions such as key rotation, lifecycle management, revocation, and audit logging are handled through AWS KMS and Secrets Manager in accordance with defined security policies. No additional hardware security modules, license keys, or external encryption appliances are required to enable encryption within the service. Any incremental cost is limited to standard AWS KMS and Secrets Manager usage charges, which scale predictably with workload and key volume.

==========
The testing strategy for the Enterprise File Transfer Backend Engine will follow the established NIT Services Delivery testing framework and align with the project lifecycle methodology. Testing will be structured across multiple layers, including unit testing of orchestration logic and Lambda components, integration testing of event-driven workflows, end-to-end validation of file transfers across SFTP and S3 endpoints, and performance testing for workloads ranging from small payloads to large multi-gigabyte files. Resiliency testing will validate active-active regional behavior, partitioned execution controls, idempotency mechanisms, and failover handling. Security testing will verify encryption enforcement, IAM least-privilege access, secret management, and audit logging controls. Where applicable, synthetic monitoring scenarios and operational readiness validation will be incorporated to ensure production observability. A formal test strategy document will be maintained in alignment with the NIT_SD Test Template and updated throughout the project lifecycle.

======
The migration strategy will emphasize controlled rollout, minimal operational disruption, and clear rollback mechanisms. Initial onboarding of endpoints and configurations will occur in lower environments, followed by staged promotion into production using infrastructure-as-code and controlled deployment pipelines. Data required for migration, including endpoint metadata and credentials, will be securely loaded via API-driven configuration workflows and validated prior to activation. During transition, parallel run capability may be leveraged to validate transfer behavior against legacy processes where applicable. The architecture’s partitioned active-active model and S3 staging pattern support operational re-drive and controlled rollback in the event of failures. Fallback procedures will include disabling specific partitions or endpoints, rerouting execution to alternate regions, and reprocessing failed transfers using durable staging artifacts. Detailed migration sequencing, communication plans, and operational checkpoints will be documented in the project implementation plan and traced to relevant business and non-functional requirements.

=======
The event logging strategy for the Enterprise File Transfer Backend Engine is designed to provide comprehensive observability, traceability, and auditability across orchestration and transfer layers. All application, workflow, and infrastructure events are centrally captured using AWS CloudWatch Logs and AWS CloudTrail within AWS GovCloud. Structured, correlation-aware logging is implemented across Step Functions, Lambda, Fargate tasks, and API components to ensure end-to-end traceability of each transfer job using unique job identifiers. Logs capture lifecycle events such as job initiation, validation, partition ownership, execution start and completion, retries, failures, and status updates. Security-relevant events—including authentication, authorization decisions, key usage, and secret access—are logged for audit and compliance purposes. Log retention policies align with enterprise standards, and log streams are integrated with centralized monitoring and alerting systems to enable proactive incident detection. This approach ensures failures are isolated, diagnosable, and recoverable while supporting regulatory audit requirements and operational analytics.
=========

The Enterprise File Transfer Backend Engine does not maintain persistent local storage within application runtime environments. Instead, it leverages AWS GovCloud managed storage services for durable and secure data persistence. The solution stores configuration metadata in Amazon DynamoDB, temporary staging artifacts (where required for SFTP-to-SFTP transfers or re-drive capability) in Amazon S3, and sensitive credentials such as SFTP usernames, private keys, and API tokens in AWS Secrets Manager. No long-term data is stored within Fargate task containers or Lambda execution environments.

The primary data types handled by the system include customer file data in transit, configuration metadata, job execution state, audit logs, and encrypted secrets. Customer file payloads are stored durably in Amazon S3 when staging is required, with encryption at rest enforced using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Configuration and workflow state data stored in DynamoDB are also encrypted using KMS-backed encryption. Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager are encrypted using KMS and accessed only through least-privilege IAM roles. Encryption is provided by underlying AWS managed services rather than being implemented directly within the application code. The architecture therefore depends on AWS-native encryption mechanisms for data at rest, TLS for data in transit, and centralized IAM policies for access control.

The system does not utilize local caching mechanisms for persistent business data, and runtime components are designed to remain stateless wherever possible. This approach reduces operational risk, limits blast radius in the event of failure, and ensures durability and compliance are handled through enterprise-grade managed services.

===========

The Enterprise File Transfer Backend Engine will leverage standard enterprise baseline monitoring services provided within AWS GovCloud, with the centralized monitoring team engaged for integration and operational oversight. Infrastructure-level monitoring is implemented using Amazon CloudWatch metrics and logs for Step Functions, Lambda, ECS Fargate tasks, DynamoDB, S3, EventBridge, and SQS. Custom application metrics will be emitted to track critical job lifecycle events such as job creation, partition ownership acquisition, transfer initiation, completion status, retry attempts, failure conditions, and latency thresholds. Synthetic monitoring and health-check workflows will be implemented to validate API availability, workflow execution paths, and cross-region failover readiness. Monitoring data from infrastructure metrics, application logs, CloudTrail audit events, and transfer status records will be aggregated and correlated using centralized observability tooling to enable proactive alerting, incident triage, and root cause analysis. Alerts will be configured for threshold breaches, execution failures, backlog accumulation, and cross-region synchronization issues to ensure rapid detection and containment of operational issues.
