The proposed solution delivers several key benefits aligned with enterprise architecture principles. From a resiliency perspective, the system is designed with multi-region high availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR), enabling controlled failover behavior across regions to ensure continuity of operations. Security is implemented following Zero Trust principles, incorporating strong identity enforcement, encryption in transit and at rest, and least-privilege access controls to protect sensitive data and credentials. Reliability is achieved through idempotent execution mechanisms and distributed locking strategies that prevent duplicate file delivery and ensure consistent outcomes even under retry scenarios. The architecture is highly scalable, supporting file sizes ranging from small payloads to very large transfers with predictable performance characteristics. Operational excellence is supported through centralized logging, metrics, monitoring, documented runbooks, and defined rollback strategies to enable effective incident response and maintainability. Finally, while the solution is backend-focused, it provides self-service capabilities through APIs that allow customers to onboard SFTP and S3 endpoints and track transfer status programmatically, enabling transparency and automation without requiring a graphical interface.
