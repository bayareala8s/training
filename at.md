| Section        | Description                                                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source`       | Connection to the SFTP server, file pattern (e.g., `*.csv`), retry and timeout settings.  |
| `destination`  | Target S3 bucket/prefix, whether to add a timestamp, overwrite policy, and storage class. |

| `validation`   | Checksum verification (e.g., MD5) before upload; optional deletion of source file.        |
| `notification` | Email/SNS notifications on success or failure.                                            |
| `logging`      | CloudWatch Logs, granularity per file, and log group.                                     |
| `meta`         | Useful tags for tracking onboarding, projects, customer ownership.                        |



✅ This JSON Can Be Used By:
Step Functions to invoke a custom state machine per transfer_id

Lambda or Fargate jobs using JSON-based orchestration

A self-service UI where customers upload this config

A DynamoDB or S3-based metadata store for centralized tracking


| Attribute                | Purpose                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `min_size_bytes`         | Skip files smaller than threshold (e.g., empty or partial files).                       |
| `max_size_bytes`         | Prevent oversized transfers that could break system limits.                             |
| `modified_after`         | Only transfer recently updated files (e.g., last 24h).                                  |
| `required_extension`     | Ensures only `.csv` or `.json` files are considered.                                    |
| `max_file_age_days`      | Drop old stale files on source SFTP.                                                    |
| `checksum_provided`      | Set `true` if source system gives an MD5/SHA hash for validation.                       |
| `filename_prefix/suffix` | Filters on filename patterns.                                                           |
| `rename_on_upload`       | Dynamically rename file before placing in S3, useful for deduplication or timestamping. |



✅ Why This Matters in Enterprise Workflows
Benefit	Enabled By
Compliance	Audit trail, retention, checksum tracking
Error handling	Skip corrupt or incomplete files
Business rules	Only process .csv of today’s reports
Operational stability	Prevents oversized or stale uploads
Metadata-driven routing	Add logic to Step Functions or Lambda for routing

| Benefit of Including in JSON    | Why It’s Useful                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Automates onboarding            | Attach policies programmatically       |
| Enables validation              | You can audit required permissions     |
| Supports IaC and CI/CD          | Terraform, CloudFormation integrations |
| Ensures security best practices | Least privilege & bucket-only access   |


current JSON is very robust and production-grade, but here are a few enhancements and optional fields that can take it to the next enterprise level — especially for large-scale, multi-tenant environments or automation systems.

🔒 1. Security & Compliance
✅ Enables S3 server-side encryption, network boundaries, and audit traceability.

⏱️ 2. Timeouts, Backoff, Retry Policy
✅ Helps automate retry handling and protect systems from hung transfers.

📦 3. Post-Processing Hooks
✅ Useful when a post-transfer process must run (e.g., file tagging, notifications, transformation).

🗂️ 4. Metadata and Tagging
✅ These can be applied to S3 objects or used for searching/filtering in UI.

📊 5. Observability Enhancements
✅ Enables dashboards, alerts, and long-term monitoring of performance and failures.

🧠 6. Workflow Customization (Optional)
✅ Allows orchestration engines (like Step Functions) to branch or schedule based on metadata.


| Section             | Why Add It                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `security`          | Encryption, network control        |
| `execution_control` | Retry logic, runtime control       |
| `post_processing`   | Trigger events or workflows after  |
| `tags`              | Better governance and traceability |
| `monitoring`        | CloudWatch integration and metrics |
| `workflow`          | Integrates with orchestrators      |


Here’s a **Microsoft Teams message** you can post to your **Scrum Master, Senior Manager, and UI/UX Team** to review the finalized JSON templates and associated data catalogs for different AWS file transfer flows:

---

### 📣 Teams Message Draft:

👋 Hi Team,

As part of our enterprise file transfer automation initiative, I’ve finalized the **standardized JSON templates and data catalogs** for the following file transfer flows:

---

### ✅ Transfer Flows Covered:

1. **SFTP → S3**
2. **S3 → SFTP**
3. **S3 → S3**
4. **SFTP → SFTP**

Each JSON includes:

* 📦 Source & destination definitions
* 📅 Scheduling configuration
* ✅ File attributes & validation logic
* 🔐 Security, network, and encryption settings
* 📊 Logging, monitoring, post-processing hooks
* 📁 Metadata and tagging for compliance & traceability

Each flow is also supported by an **Excel data catalog** documenting all field definitions for UI onboarding, validation, and dynamic form rendering.

### 🔍 Action Items:

* 🧩 **UI/UX Team**: Please review the data catalogs for form design, validations, field grouping, and tooltips.
* 📋 **Scrum Master**: Please incorporate these templates into the onboarding workflow stories.
* 📈 **Senior Manager**: This aligns with our goal of enabling scalable, secure, and self-serve onboarding for internal and external customers.

Let me know if you'd like a working demo or visualization of how these configs map to the backend services.
