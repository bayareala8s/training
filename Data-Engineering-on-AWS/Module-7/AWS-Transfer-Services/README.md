### Summary

These Terraform scripts create the necessary AWS infrastructure for each of the real-world examples, leveraging AWS Transfer Family, S3, IAM, Lambda, CloudFront, Glue, and RDS. You can customize these scripts further based on specific requirements and settings for your use case.


### Example 1: Financial Services - Secure Data Exchange

#### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Define Provider**:
   - Specify the AWS provider and region in the `main.tf` file.
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }
   ```

2. **Create IAM Role for SFTP**:
   - Define an IAM role that AWS Transfer Family can assume.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_iam_role" "sftp_role" {
     name = "SFTPTransferRole"
     assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
       Version = "2012-10-17",
       Statement = [
         {
           Effect = "Allow",
           Principal = {
             Service = "transfer.amazonaws.com"
           },
           Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
         }
       ]
     })
   }
   ```

     role   = aws_iam_role.sftp_role.id
     policy = jsonencode({
       Version = "2012-10-17",
       Statement = [
         {
           Effect = "Allow",
           Action = [
             "s3:ListBucket",
             "s3:GetObject",
             "s3:PutObject"
           ],
           Resource = [
             "arn:aws:s3:::my-sftp-bucket",
             "arn:aws:s3:::my-sftp-bucket/*"
           ]
         }
       ]
     })
   }
   ```

4. **Create SFTP Server**:
   - Set up the AWS Transfer Family server with the SFTP protocol.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_transfer_server" "sftp_server" {
     endpoint_type = "PUBLIC"
     identity_provider_type = "SERVICE_MANAGED"
     tags = {
       Name = "MySFTPServer"
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Create User Accounts for SFTP**:
   - Create user accounts and specify their home directories in the S3 bucket.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_transfer_user" "sftp_user" {
     user_name = "sftp_user"
     server_id = aws_transfer_server.sftp_server.id
     role = aws_iam_role.sftp_role.arn
     home_directory = "/my-sftp-bucket"
     home_directory_mappings = [{
       entry = "/"
       target = "/my-sftp-bucket"
     }]
     tags = {
       Name = "SFTPUser"
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Set Up Amazon RDS**:
   - Create an RDS instance to store inventory data.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_rds_instance" "default" {
     allocated_storage    = 20
     storage_type         = "gp2"
     engine               = "mysql"
     engine_version       = "8.0"
     instance_class       = "db.t3.micro"
     name                 = "mydb"
     username             = "admin"
     password             = "mypassword"
     parameter_group_name = "default.mysql8.0"
     skip_final_snapshot  = true
   }
   ```

7. **Set Up AWS Lambda**:
   - Create a Lambda function to process incoming inventory data and update RDS.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_lambda_function" "process_inventory" {
     filename         = "lambda_function_payload.zip"
     function_name    = "ProcessInventory"
     role             = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec.arn
     handler          = "index.handler"
     source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("lambda_function_payload.zip")
     runtime          = "nodejs14.x"
   }

   resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_exec" {
     name = "lambda_exec"
     assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
       Version : "2012-10-17",
       Statement : [
         {
           Effect : "Allow",
           Principal : {
             Service : "lambda.amazonaws.com"
           },
           Action : "sts:AssumeRole"
         }
       ]
     })
   }

   resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "lambda_policy_attachment" {
     role       = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec.name
     policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"
   }
   ```

8. **Configure S3 Event Notification**:
   - Set up S3 bucket event notifications to trigger the Lambda function when new files are uploaded.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_notification" "s3_notification" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_sftp_bucket.id

     lambda_function {
       lambda_function_arn = aws_lambda_function.process_inventory.arn
       events              = ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]
     }
   }

   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_sftp_bucket" {
     bucket = "my-sftp-bucket"
   }
   ```

### Summary

Each Terraform script defines the necessary AWS resources to implement the respective real-world examples. The steps include setting up IAM roles and policies, configuring AWS Transfer Family servers, creating user accounts, and integrating with other AWS services like S3, Lambda, RDS, Glue, and CloudFront. The scripts provide a comprehensive setup to ensure secure, reliable

, and scalable file transfers tailored to specific business needs.
