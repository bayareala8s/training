By following these steps, you have set up a real-time file processing pipeline using AWS Lambda and S3. Whenever a new file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, the Lambda function is triggered to process the file. This setup can be extended to include more complex processing logic as per your requirements.


Here's a complete Terraform script to set up the real-time file processing with AWS Lambda and S3 as described in the guide. The script includes creating an S3 bucket, an IAM role, and a Lambda function.

### Step 1: Create the Terraform Configuration File

Create a file named `main.tf` and add the following content:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Change to your preferred region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "my-real-time-file-processing-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_exec_role" {
  name = "lambda_exec_role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action    = "sts:AssumeRole"
      Principal = {
        Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      }
      Effect    = "Allow"
      Sid       = ""
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "lambda_basic_execution" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "s3_read_access" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess"
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "file_processor" {
  function_name = "RealTimeFileProcessor"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec_role.arn
  handler       = "lambda_function.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"
  
  filename = "lambda.zip"

  source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("lambda.zip")
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_notification" "bucket_notification" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.id

  lambda_function {
    lambda_function_arn = aws_lambda_function.file_processor.arn
    events              = ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_lambda_permission" "allow_s3" {
  statement_id  = "AllowS3Invoke"
  action        = "lambda:InvokeFunction"
  function_name = aws_lambda_function.file_processor.function_name
  principal     = "s3.amazonaws.com"
  source_arn    = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.arn
}

output "s3_bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.bucket
}

output "lambda_function_name" {
  value = aws_lambda_function.file_processor.function_name
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Lambda Function Code

Create a file named `lambda_function.py` with the following content:

```python
import json
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Get the bucket name and file key from the event
    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

    # Fetch the file from S3
    response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
    file_content = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')

    # Process the file (for demonstration, we'll just print its content)
    print(f"Processing file from bucket: {bucket}, key: {key}")
    print(f"File content: {file_content}")

    # You can add more processing logic here

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('File processed successfully')
    }
```

### Step 3: Create a Deployment Package

Zip the `lambda_function.py` file into a deployment package:

```bash
zip lambda.zip lambda_function.py
```

### Step 4: Initialize and Apply the Terraform Configuration

1. Initialize the Terraform configuration:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

2. Apply the Terraform configuration:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

   Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the creation of resources.

### Summary

By following these steps, you have used Terraform to set up an AWS environment for real-time file processing with AWS Lambda and S3. The Terraform script handles the creation of the S3 bucket, IAM role, Lambda function, and necessary permissions and notifications. Whenever a new file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, the Lambda function will be triggered to process the file.

1. Go to the AWS Lambda console.
2. Select your Lambda function (`StreamProcessorLambda`).
3. Click on the "Monitor" tab and then "View logs in CloudWatch".
4. Check the CloudWatch logs to see the output of your Lambda function. You should see logs indicating that the payloads were decoded and printed.

## Terraform Script

### Step 10: Create the Terraform Configuration File

Create a file named `main.tf` and add the following content:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Change to your preferred region
}

resource "aws_kinesis_stream" "kinesis_stream" {
  name             = "my-kinesis-stream"
  shard_count      = 1
  retention_period = 24
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_kinesis_role" {
  name = "lambda_kinesis_role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action    = "sts:AssumeRole"
      Principal = {
        Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      }
      Effect    = "Allow"
      Sid       = ""
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "lambda_basic_execution" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.lambda_kinesis_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "kinesis_read_access" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.lambda_kinesis_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonKinesisReadOnlyAccess"
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "stream_processor_lambda" {
  function_name = "StreamProcessorLambda"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda_kinesis_role.arn
  handler       = "stream_processor_lambda.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"
  
  filename = "stream_processor_lambda.zip"

  source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("stream_processor_lambda.zip")
}

resource "aws_lambda_event_source_mapping" "kinesis_trigger" {
  event_source_arn  = aws_kinesis_stream.kinesis_stream.arn
  function_name     = aws_lambda_function.stream_processor_lambda.arn
  starting_position = "LATEST"
  batch_size        = 100
}

output "kinesis_stream_name" {
  value = aws_kinesis_stream.kinesis_stream.name
}

output "lambda_function_name" {
  value = aws_lambda_function.stream_processor_lambda.function_name
}
```

### Summary

By following these steps, you have set up a real-time stream processing pipeline using AWS Lambda and Kinesis. The Terraform script handles the creation of the Kinesis stream, IAM role, Lambda function, and necessary permissions and triggers. Whenever a new record is put into the Kinesis stream, the Lambda function will be triggered to process the record.

    terraform apply
    ```

   Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the creation of resources.

### Summary

By following these steps, you have set up a serverless backend for a mobile application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The Terraform script handles the creation of the DynamoDB table, IAM role, Lambda function, API Gateway resources, and necessary permissions and integrations. This setup allows you to create and retrieve user data through a RESTful API.


AWS Lambda is a powerful service for serverless data processing, but it comes with several limitations that you should be aware of. Here are the key limitations:

### 1. **Execution Timeout**
- **Maximum Execution Time**: AWS Lambda functions have a maximum execution timeout of 15 minutes. If your data processing task takes longer than this, you will need to break it into smaller tasks or use other AWS services such as AWS Step Functions to orchestrate longer-running workflows.

### 2. **Resource Limits**
- **Memory Allocation**: Lambda functions can be allocated memory between 128 MB to 10,240 MB (10 GB). If your data processing tasks require more memory, you may need to consider other services or architectures.
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Each Lambda function has 512 MB of ephemeral storage in the `/tmp` directory. This storage is for temporary files only and is not persisted between invocations. For larger temporary storage needs, consider using Amazon S3.

### 3. **Concurrency Limits**
- **Account Concurrency Limits**: AWS enforces a default regional concurrency limit of 1,000 invocations per account. This can be increased by requesting a limit increase through AWS Support.
- **Reserved Concurrency**: You can reserve a portion of your account’s concurrency limit for a specific function. However, reserving concurrency limits may affect other Lambda functions running in your account.

### 4. **Cold Start Latency**
- **Cold Starts**: When a Lambda function is invoked for the first time or after being idle, it experiences a cold start which can introduce latency. This is especially noticeable for functions with large deployment packages or those requiring a VPC connection.

### 5. **Deployment Package Size**
- **Deployment Package Size**: The maximum size of a Lambda deployment package is 50 MB (compressed) and 250 MB (uncompressed, including layers). For larger dependencies, you need to use Lambda layers or S3 to store the dependencies.

### 6. **Limited Execution Environment**
- **Execution Environment**: Lambda functions run in a stateless, constrained execution environment. There are restrictions on the available libraries and system calls, and you cannot use certain features like multi-threading or background processes in the same way you can with traditional servers.

### 7. **Networking Constraints**
- **VPC Networking**: If your Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC, such as RDS instances, there may be added cold start latency and you must ensure proper subnet and security group configurations.
- **Outbound Internet Access**: Lambda functions not running inside a VPC have automatic outbound internet access. However, if they are in a VPC, they need a NAT gateway or a NAT instance for outbound internet access.

### 8. **Error Handling and Retries**
- **Limited Retry Mechanisms**: While Lambda has built-in retry mechanisms for asynchronous invocations, these retries might not be sufficient for all use cases. You might need to implement additional error handling and retry logic.

### 9. **Monitoring and Debugging**
- **Limited Built-in Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch provides basic logging and monitoring, but more detailed observability might require integrating with third-party tools or additional AWS services like X-Ray.

### 10. **Cost Considerations**
- **Cost**: While AWS Lambda can be cost-effective for many use cases, it might become expensive for workloads with high concurrency or long-running processes due to the pay-per-invocation and pay-per-duration pricing model.

### 11. **Language and Runtime Support**
- **Limited Language Support**: While AWS Lambda supports several popular languages (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET Core), it might not support every language or runtime version you need. Custom runtimes can be used, but they require additional maintenance.

### Summary

While AWS Lambda is a robust and scalable option for serverless data processing, it's essential to understand these limitations and design your applications accordingly. For tasks that exceed these limitations, you might need to consider using other AWS services or hybrid architectures.


AWS Lambda, AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), and AWS Fargate are three distinct AWS services designed to run and manage applications, but each has its own unique characteristics and use cases. Here’s a detailed guide on the differences between these services:

## Overview

### AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that automatically manages the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers.

### AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
AWS EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that allows you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.

### AWS Fargate
AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and Amazon EKS, allowing you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

## Key Differences

### 1. Architecture and Management

**AWS Lambda**
- **Serverless**: No need to provision or manage servers.
- **Event-driven**: Automatically runs code in response to events such as HTTP requests, changes in data, or modifications in state.
- **Fully Managed**: AWS handles the infrastructure, scaling, patching, and high availability.

**AWS EKS**
- **Kubernetes-based**: Uses Kubernetes to manage containerized applications.
- **Cluster Management**: Requires managing Kubernetes clusters, including worker nodes.
- **Scalability**: Scales using Kubernetes tools and policies. You are responsible for scaling your application and cluster.

**AWS Fargate**
- **Serverless Containers**: Runs containers without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Works with ECS and EKS**: Integrates with both ECS and EKS to manage containers.
- **Fully Managed**: AWS handles the provisioning, scaling, and management of the underlying infrastructure.

### 2. Use Cases

**AWS Lambda**
- **Microservices**: Ideal for microservices that require rapid scaling and are event-driven.
- **Automation**: Great for automating tasks like data processing, backups, and file system changes.
- **Short-lived tasks**: Best for short-duration tasks and functions that run for a limited time.

**AWS EKS**
- **Complex Applications**: Suitable for running complex, multi-container applications using Kubernetes.
- **Custom Scheduling**: Offers advanced scheduling and orchestration capabilities for large-scale applications.

**AWS Fargate**
- **Simple to Moderate Complexity**: Ideal for applications that need container orchestration without the overhead of managing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Batch Processing**: Suitable for batch jobs, processing data streams, and other task-based workloads.
- **Scalable Web Applications**: Good for scalable web services that can benefit from containerization.

### 3. Pricing Model

**AWS Lambda**
- **Pay-per-Request**: Charges based on the number of requests and the duration your code runs.
- **Free Tier**: Includes 1 million free requests and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.

**AWS EKS**
- **Cluster Fee**: Charged for each EKS cluster you create.
- **EC2 Pricing**: Pay for the EC2 instances you use as worker nodes.
- **Fargate Pricing**: If using Fargate with EKS, you pay for the Fargate usage.

**AWS Fargate**
- **Pay-per-Usage**: Charges based on the vCPU and memory resources consumed by your containerized applications.
- **No Infrastructure Cost**: No need to pay for EC2 instances or other underlying infrastructure directly.

### 4. Scalability

**AWS Lambda**
- **Automatic Scaling**: Automatically scales up and down based on the number of incoming requests.
- **Concurrency Limits**: AWS manages concurrency limits, with a default limit that can be increased.

**AWS EKS**
- **Manual/Automatic Scaling**: Requires configuring Kubernetes auto-scaling tools like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler.
- **Custom Scaling Policies**: Full control over scaling policies and behavior.

**AWS Fargate**
- **Automatic Scaling**: Automatically scales the number of running tasks based on defined task requirements and resource utilization.
- **ECS/EKS Integration**: Uses ECS/EKS scaling mechanisms for service scaling.

### 5. Flexibility and Control

**AWS Lambda**
- **Limited Control**: Limited control over the underlying infrastructure and runtime environment.
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies application deployment and management, focusing on code rather than infrastructure.

**AWS EKS**
- **Full Control**: Full control over Kubernetes clusters, including the ability to customize nodes, networking, and storage.
- **Flexibility**: Can run any containerized application that conforms to Kubernetes standards.

**AWS Fargate**
- **Moderate Control**: More control than Lambda but less than managing EC2 instances directly.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with ECS/EKS, providing a balance of control and simplicity.

## Detailed Example Scenarios

### AWS Lambda Example

**Use Case**: Image Processing
1. **Trigger**: An image is uploaded to an S3 bucket.
2. **Lambda Function**: Automatically triggered to process the image (e.g., resize, compress).
3. **Output**: Processed image is saved back to the S3 bucket.

### AWS EKS Example

**Use Case**: Multi-Container Web Application
1. **Cluster Setup**: Create an EKS cluster with multiple worker nodes.
2. **Deployment**: Deploy a multi-container web application using Kubernetes manifests.
3. **Management**: Use Kubernetes tools for scaling, monitoring, and managing the application.

### AWS Fargate Example

**Use Case**: API Backend
1. **Task Definition**: Define the container configuration for your API backend.
2. **Service Setup**: Create an ECS service using Fargate to run the containers.
