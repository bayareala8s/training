## Summary

By following these steps, you have set up a real-time file processing pipeline using AWS Lambda and S3. Whenever a new file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, the Lambda function is triggered to process the file. This setup can be extended to include more complex processing logic as per your requirements.


Here's a complete Terraform script to set up the real-time file processing with AWS Lambda and S3 as described in the guide. The script includes creating an S3 bucket, an IAM role, and a Lambda function.

### Step 1: Create the Terraform Configuration File

Create a file named `main.tf` and add the following content:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Change to your preferred region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "my-real-time-file-processing-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_exec_role" {
  name = "lambda_exec_role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action    = "sts:AssumeRole"
      Principal = {
        Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      }
      Effect    = "Allow"
      Sid       = ""
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "lambda_basic_execution" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "s3_read_access" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess"
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "file_processor" {
  function_name = "RealTimeFileProcessor"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec_role.arn
  handler       = "lambda_function.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"
  
  filename = "lambda.zip"

  source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("lambda.zip")
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_notification" "bucket_notification" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.id

  lambda_function {
    lambda_function_arn = aws_lambda_function.file_processor.arn
    events              = ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_lambda_permission" "allow_s3" {
  statement_id  = "AllowS3Invoke"
  action        = "lambda:InvokeFunction"
  function_name = aws_lambda_function.file_processor.function_name
  principal     = "s3.amazonaws.com"
  source_arn    = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.arn
}

output "s3_bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.bucket
}

output "lambda_function_name" {
  value = aws_lambda_function.file_processor.function_name
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Lambda Function Code

Create a file named `lambda_function.py` with the following content:

```python
import json
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Get the bucket name and file key from the event
    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

    # Fetch the file from S3
    response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
    file_content = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')

    # Process the file (for demonstration, we'll just print its content)
    print(f"Processing file from bucket: {bucket}, key: {key}")
    print(f"File content: {file_content}")

    # You can add more processing logic here

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('File processed successfully')
    }
```

### Step 3: Create a Deployment Package

Zip the `lambda_function.py` file into a deployment package:

```bash
zip lambda.zip lambda_function.py
```

### Step 4: Initialize and Apply the Terraform Configuration

1. Initialize the Terraform configuration:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

2. Apply the Terraform configuration:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

   Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the creation of resources.

### Summary

By following these steps, you have used Terraform to set up an AWS environment for real-time file processing with AWS Lambda and S3. The Terraform script handles the creation of the S3 bucket, IAM role, Lambda function, and necessary permissions and notifications. Whenever a new file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, the Lambda function will be triggered to process the file.
