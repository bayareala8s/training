Since your focus is on **AWS File Transfers** and **AWS Lambda for file transfers**, Iâ€™ve refined the **DynaTrace** and **Grafana Dashboard observability areas** to align with your specific use case.

---

### **1. DynaTrace Observability for AWS File Transfers & Lambda**  

#### **a) AWS Transfer Family (SFTP, FTPS, FTP) Monitoring**  
- **Connection Monitoring**  
  - Track active user sessions and connections  
  - Identify failed login attempts and unauthorized access  
- **File Transfer Performance**  
  - Monitor transfer speeds, latencies, and throughput  
  - Detect delays in file transfers from source to target  
- **Transfer Success/Failure Metrics**  
  - Log successful vs. failed file transfers with reasons  
  - Monitor AWS S3 event notifications for file arrival  

#### **b) AWS Lambda Monitoring for File Processing**  
- **Invocation Metrics**  
  - Track Lambda execution count, duration, and concurrency  
  - Identify slow or failed executions due to memory/cold starts  
- **Error & Exception Tracking**  
  - Capture function errors, timeouts, and retries  
  - Debug issues using AWS CloudWatch logs  
- **Downstream System Integration**  
  - Monitor interactions with AWS S3, DynamoDB, RDS, or external APIs  
  - Identify latency issues in downstream services affecting transfers  

#### **c) AWS S3 Event Monitoring**  
- **File Event Tracking**  
  - Monitor object creation, modification, and deletion events  
  - Ensure event triggers for Lambda execution are working correctly  
- **Bucket Performance & Access**  
  - Monitor S3 request rates, throttling, and latency  
  - Identify unauthorized access or permission issues  

#### **d) Alerting & Incident Response**  
- **Threshold-Based Alerts**  
  - Set up alerts for failed file transfers, high latency, or Lambda failures  
  - Automate ticket creation in ServiceNow for incidents  
- **Anomaly Detection**  
  - Detect unusual spikes in transfer failures  
  - Identify unauthorized file access or large unexpected file transfers

### **2. Grafana Observability for AWS File Transfers & Lambda**  

#### **a) File Transfer Metrics Dashboard**  
- **SFTP/FTPS/FTP Transfer Status**  
  - Number of successful vs. failed file transfers  
  - Transfer speed, latency, and throughput per session  
- **S3 File Movement Tracking**  
  - Number of files uploaded, processed, and moved to the target  
  - Time taken for files to reach the destination  

#### **b) AWS Lambda Execution Dashboard**  
- **Function Execution Trends**  
  - Number of invocations per hour/day  
  - Execution duration and memory consumption trends  
- **Error Tracking & Failures**  
  - Graph failed executions and error reasons  
  - Alert when failures exceed thresholds  

#### **c) AWS Transfer Family & S3 Performance Dashboard**  
- **Service Health Monitoring**  
  - AWS Transfer Family server uptime & availability  
  - S3 bucket request rates and performance  
- **Access & Security Logs**  
  - Monitor unauthorized access attempts  
  - Track permission changes and bucket policy violations  

#### **d) Alerts & Notifications in Grafana**  
- **Real-Time Alerts for Issues**  
  - Notify on failed transfers, high Lambda execution times  
  - Integrate with Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, or Slack for incident response  
- **Custom Dashboards for Teams**  
  - Create separate dashboards for **Ops (infrastructure)** and **Dev (Lambda processing)**
