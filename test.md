### **Step-by-Step Guide: Automated Integration Testing for AWS File Transfer Services (GGG Group)**  

This guide details how to set up **automated integration testing** for the **AWS File Transfer Service** used by the **GGG group**, which transfers files from **Source AAA S3 bucket** to **Target CCCC S3 bucket** using **Python AWS Lambda**.

---

## **Step 1: Define the Testing Scope**
Before implementing automation, define what needs to be tested:
1. **File Transfer Success** – Ensure files are successfully copied from the **AAA bucket** to the **CCCC bucket**.
2. **File Integrity Validation** – Validate that files are not altered or corrupted during the transfer.
3. **Error Handling** – Ensure errors are logged and handled when:
   - A file does not exist in the source bucket.
   - The Lambda function does not have permissions.
   - The target bucket is unavailable.
4. **Performance Testing** – Measure time taken for the Lambda to copy files.

---

## **Step 2: Set Up the Testing Environment**
- **Create a Test Source S3 Bucket (`AAA-test`)**
- **Create a Test Target S3 Bucket (`CCCC-test`)**
- **Deploy a Test Lambda Function** identical to the production version but pointing to the test buckets.

---

## **Step 3: Set Up a Test Automation Framework**
We will use **pytest** and **boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)** for automation.

### **Required Python Libraries**
```bash
pip install pytest boto3 moto
```

- **pytest** – Testing framework.
- **boto3** – AWS SDK for interacting with AWS resources.
- **moto** – AWS mocking library for unit tests.

---

## **Step 4: Configure IAM Permissions for Testing**
Ensure your test Lambda has the following permissions:

```json
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
    ],
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::AAA-test/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::CCCC-test/*",
        "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
    ]
}
```

---

## **Step 5: Write the Automated Integration Test Cases**
Create a `test_lambda_transfer.py` file.

### **Test Case 1: Verify Lambda Copies Files Successfully**
```python
import boto3
import pytest
import time
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

# AWS S3 setup
AWS_REGION = "us-west-2"
SOURCE_BUCKET = "AAA-test"
TARGET_BUCKET = "CCCC-test"
TEST_FILE = "test_file.txt"

s3_client = boto3.client("s3", region_name=AWS_REGION)

def upload_test_file():
    """Uploads a test file to the source bucket before running the test"""
    s3_client.put_object(Bucket=SOURCE_BUCKET, Key=TEST_FILE, Body="This is a test file.")

def test_lambda_file_transfer():
    """Test Lambda function for file transfer"""
    upload_test_file()
    
    # Trigger Lambda function (Assuming it's invoked via an event or test manually)
    lambda_client = boto3.client("lambda", region_name=AWS_REGION)
    response = lambda_client.invoke(
        FunctionName="GGGFileTransferLambda",
        InvocationType="Event"
    )
    
    assert response["StatusCode"] == 202  # Check if Lambda was triggered successfully

    # Wait for Lambda to process the file
    time.sleep(5)

    # Verify file exists in target bucket
    try:
        response = s3_client.head_object(Bucket=TARGET_BUCKET, Key=TEST_FILE)
        assert response is not None
    except ClientError:
        pytest.fail("File was not transferred to the target bucket.")

```

---

### **Test Case 2: Validate File Integrity**
```python
def test_file_integrity():
    """Ensure the transferred file is not corrupted"""
    original_file = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=SOURCE_BUCKET, Key=TEST_FILE)["Body"].read()
    copied_file = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=TARGET_BUCKET, Key=TEST_FILE)["Body"].read()

    assert original_file == copied_file, "File integrity check failed!"
```

---

### **Test Case 3: Handle Missing File Error**
```python
def test_missing_file():
    """Test Lambda error handling when source file is missing"""
    missing_file = "non_existent.txt"
    
    lambda_client = boto3.client("lambda", region_name=AWS_REGION)
    response = lambda_client.invoke(
        FunctionName="GGGFileTransferLambda",
        InvocationType="RequestResponse"
    )

    response_payload = response["Payload"].read().decode()
    
    assert "NoSuchKey" in response_payload, "Lambda did not handle missing file error correctly"
```

---

### **Test Case 4: Verify Lambda Logs Errors Correctly**
```python
def test_lambda_error_logging():
    """Ensure Lambda logs errors when encountering failures"""
    logs_client = boto3.client("logs", region_name=AWS_REGION)
    log_group = "/aws/lambda/GGGFileTransferLambda"
    
    # Get latest logs
    response = logs_client.describe_log_streams(
        logGroupName=log_group, orderBy="LastEventTime", descending=True
    )

    assert len(response["logStreams"]) > 0, "Lambda logs are missing!"
```

---

## **Step 6: Run the Automated Tests**
Execute the test cases using `pytest`:
```bash
pytest -v test_lambda_transfer.py
```

---

## **Step 7: Automate Tests in CI/CD Pipeline**
Integrate the tests into a CI/CD pipeline (AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins).

### **GitHub Actions Example**
Create `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`:

```yaml
name: Integration Test AWS File Transfer

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pip install pytest boto3

      - name: Run Tests
        env:
          AWS_REGION: us-west-2
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        run: pytest -v test_lambda_transfer.py
```

---

## **Step 8: Monitor Test Results and Debug Failures**
1. **Check AWS CloudWatch Logs**  
   - Go to AWS Console → CloudWatch → Log Groups → `/aws/lambda/GGGFileTransferLambda`
2. **Review CI/CD Test Results**  
   - If using GitHub Actions, check **"Actions"** tab.
3. **Modify Lambda Function If Needed**  
   - If tests fail, update your Lambda function and redeploy.

---

## **Conclusion**
This step-by-step guide sets up **automated integration testing** for **AWS File Transfer Service (GGG Group)**. By implementing **pytest + boto3**, ensuring **file integrity validation**, and **automating in a CI/CD pipeline**, you ensure reliable file transfers with AWS Lambda.

```

This **ASCII-based architecture diagram** outlines the **test framework, AWS components, test cases, CI/CD integration, and logging mechanisms**. It provides a high-level **flow** of how the automated integration testing works for **AWS File Transfer Services (GGG Group).** 🚀 


### **Detailed Flow of Automated Integration Testing for AWS File Transfer Services (GGG Group)**  

This flow outlines how the **Automated Integration Testing** process works for **AWS File Transfer Services (GGG Group)**, which transfers files from **Source AAA S3 bucket** to **Target CCCC S3 bucket** using **AWS Lambda**.

---

## **Step 1: Setup & Initialization**
- **Testing Framework:** `pytest` is used as the testing framework.
- **AWS SDK (`boto3`)** is used to interact with AWS services.
- **Test Buckets Created:**
  - `AAA-test` (Source bucket)
  - `CCCC-test` (Target bucket)
- **Test Lambda Function:** A duplicate Lambda function is deployed with logging enabled.
- **Test Configuration:** AWS credentials and permissions are configured for testing.

---

## **Step 2: Test Execution Flow**
The test automation runs **multiple test cases** to validate various aspects of the file transfer process.

### **📌 Test Execution Flow (Visual Representation)**
```
+------------------------------------------------------+
|                 Test Framework (pytest)             |
+------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                      |
| 1. Setup Test Environment                            |
|    - Create Source & Target Buckets                  |
|    - Deploy Test Lambda Function                     |
|    - Configure IAM Permissions for Testing           |
|                                                      |
| 2. Upload Test File to Source S3 Bucket (AAA-test)   |
|    - Sample Files:                                   |
|      ✅ test_file.txt                                 |
|      ✅ large_test_file.txt                           |
|      ✅ file with spaces.txt                          |
|                                                      |
| 3. Trigger AWS Lambda (GGGFileTransferLambda)        |
|    - Lambda is invoked manually via test script      |
|    - It copies files from `AAA-test` → `CCCC-test`   |
|                                                      |
| 4. Validate File Transfer Results                    |
|    - Check if file exists in Target S3 Bucket       |
|    - Validate file integrity using checksum         |
|                                                      |
| 5. Run Additional Test Scenarios                     |
|    ✅ Missing File Error Handling                    |
|    ✅ Large File Transfer Performance Test           |
|    ✅ Permission Error Handling                      |
|    ✅ Multiple Files Transfer Test                   |
|    ✅ Special Characters in Filename Test            |
|    ✅ Large Number of Files Handling                 |
|                                                      |
| 6. Validate AWS CloudWatch Logs                      |
|    - Verify Lambda Logs for Errors & Warnings       |
|                                                      |
| 7. Generate Test Report                              |
|    - Output test results in CI/CD Pipeline           |
|    - Send reports to monitoring tools (if enabled)  |
|                                                      |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

---

## **Step 3: Validation & Assertions**
After the Lambda execution, the testing framework **validates** various aspects:

1. ✅ **File Successfully Copied**  
   - Checks if the file exists in the **CCCC-test bucket**.
   
2. ✅ **File Integrity Validation**  
   - Compares the **MD5 hash** of the source and copied file.

3. ✅ **Error Handling**  
   - If the file is missing in **AAA-test**, Lambda should log an error.
   - If the Lambda lacks permissions, it should return an `AccessDenied` error.

4. ✅ **Performance Monitoring**  
   - Measures the **execution time** for large files.
   - Validates **Lambda retry mechanisms**.

5. ✅ **CloudWatch Log Validation**  
   - Ensures that **errors, warnings, and performance logs** are correctly captured.

---

## **Step 4: Automating in a CI/CD Pipeline**
Once the tests are written, they can be integrated into a **CI/CD pipeline** (AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins).

### **Example: GitHub Actions Integration**
```yaml
name: AWS File Transfer Integration Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:

- **Test Cases:**
  - ✅ Verify a single file transfers **successfully**.
  - ✅ Verify **multiple files** transfer at once.
  - ✅ Verify **different file formats** (`.txt, .csv, .json, .xml, .zip`).
  - ✅ Ensure **empty files** are transferred correctly.

- **Automation Strategy (Pytest + Boto3)**
  ```python
  def test_single_file_transfer():
      """Validate if a single file is successfully copied to the target bucket."""
      test_file_key = "test_file.txt"
      s3_client.put_object(Bucket=SOURCE_BUCKET, Key=test_file_key, Body="Test content")

      lambda_client.invoke(FunctionName="GGGFileTransferLambda", InvocationType="Event")
      time.sleep(5)  # Allow Lambda to process

      assert s3_client.head_object(Bucket=TARGET_BUCKET, Key=test_file_key) is not None, "File transfer failed!"
  ```

---

### **2️⃣ Integration Testing – AWS Lambda & S3 Interaction**
- **Test Cases:**
  - ✅ Validate Lambda **reads from the source bucket**.
  - ✅ Validate Lambda **writes to the target bucket**.
  - ✅ Validate IAM **permissions allow or deny access correctly**.
  - ✅ Validate **event triggers work correctly** (S3 event notifications, CloudWatch rules).

- **Automation Strategy (Mock IAM & S3 with Moto)**
  ```python
  @mock_s3
  def test_lambda_s3_interaction():
      """Ensure Lambda can interact with S3 and transfer files."""
      s3 = boto3.client("s3", region_name="us-west-2")
      s3.create_bucket(Bucket="AAA-test")
      s3.create_bucket(Bucket="CCCC-test")

      s3.put_object(Bucket="AAA-test", Key="test_file.txt", Body="Test content")
      my_lambda_function()  # Call Lambda handler function
      assert s3.head_object(Bucket="CCCC-test", Key="test_file.txt") is not None, "File not transferred!"
  ```

---

### **3️⃣ Security Testing – IAM Policies, Encryption & Access Control**
- **Test Cases:**
  - ✅ Ensure Lambda **only has access** to the correct S3 buckets.
  - ✅ Test **unauthorized access attempts**.
  - ✅ Verify **server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS)** is enabled.
  - ✅ Validate **VPC access controls** for private network configurations.

- **Automation Strategy (IAM Policy Testing)**
  ```python
  def test_lambda_iam_restricted_access():
      """Ensure Lambda cannot access unauthorized S3 buckets."""
      with pytest.raises(ClientError) as e:
          s3_client.get_object(Bucket="unauthorized-bucket", Key="file.txt")
      assert "AccessDenied" in str(e.value), "Lambda should not have access!"
  ```

---

### **4️⃣ Performance Testing – File Size & Lambda Execution Time**
- **Test Cases:**
  - ✅ Test **small, medium, and large file transfers** (10KB, 100MB, 1GB).
  - ✅ Measure **Lambda execution time** for different file sizes.
  - ✅ Identify if **throttling or timeouts occur** for high loads.

- **Automation Strategy (Measure Execution Time)**
  ```python
  import time

  def test_large_file_transfer():
      """Ensure Lambda handles large files efficiently."""
      large_file_key = "large_test_file.txt"
      large_file_content = "A" * (10 * 1024 * 1024)  # 10MB file

      s3_client.put_object(Bucket=SOURCE_BUCKET, Key=large_file_key, Body=large_file_content)

      start_time = time.time()
      lambda_client.invoke(FunctionName="GGGFileTransferLambda", InvocationType="Event")
      end_time = time.time()

      assert end_time - start_time < 10, "Lambda execution is too slow!"
  ```

---

### **5️⃣ Error Handling Testing – Failures & Exception Scenarios**
- **Test Cases:**
  - ✅ Handle **missing files** gracefully.
  - ✅ Handle **insufficient permissions** correctly.
  - ✅ Handle **S3 unavailability** or throttling.

- **Automation Strategy (Simulate Missing File Scenario)**
  ```python
  def test_missing_file_error():
      """Ensure Lambda logs an error when the source file is missing."""
      lambda_client.invoke(FunctionName="GGGFileTransferLambda", InvocationType="RequestResponse")
      logs = fetch_lambda_logs()
      assert "NoSuchKey" in logs, "Lambda did not log missing file error!"
  ```

---

### **6️⃣ Resilience Testing – AWS Failures & Recovery**
- **Test Cases:**
  - ✅ Simulate AWS **S3 service outage** and test failover handling.
  - ✅ Test **Lambda retries on transient failures**.
  - ✅ Validate that **file transfer resumes** after failure.

- **Automation Strategy (Introduce Artificial Delay & Retry)**
  ```python
  import botocore.exceptions

  def retry_aws_call(call_function, retries=3, delay=2):
      """Retries AWS API call in case of transient failures."""
      for attempt in range(retries):
          try:
              return call_function()
          except botocore.exceptions.ClientError:
              time.sleep(delay)
      raise Exception("AWS call failed after retries")

  def test_resilience_with_retries():
      """Ensure Lambda retries failed transfers."""
      response = retry_aws_call(lambda: s3_client.get_object(Bucket=SOURCE_BUCKET, Key="test_file.txt"))
      assert response is not None, "Lambda did not retry failed transfer!"
  ```

---

### **7️⃣ Logging & Monitoring Testing – CloudWatch & Alerts**
- **Test Cases:**
  - ✅ Ensure CloudWatch **logs all Lambda executions**.
  - ✅ Validate **error messages appear in logs**.
  - ✅ Test if **SNS alerts** trigger on failures.

  ```python
  import boto3

  def fetch_lambda_logs():
      logs_client = boto3.client("logs", region_name="us-west-2")
      log_group = "/aws/lambda/GGGFileTransferLambda"
      response = logs_client.describe_log_streams(logGroupName=log_group, orderBy="LastEventTime", descending=True)
      log_stream = response["logStreams"][0]["logStreamName"]
      log_events = logs_client.get_log_events(logGroupName=log_group, logStreamName=log_stream)
      return [event["message"] for event in log_events["events"]]

  def test_lambda_logs_for_errors():
      logs = fetch_lambda_logs()
      assert not any("ERROR" in log for log in logs), "Errors found in Lambda logs!"
  ```
