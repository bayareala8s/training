Subject: Transitioning from On-Premises Infrastructure to the Cloud â€“ A Step Toward Modernization

Dear [Customer Name/Valued Customer],

As part of our ongoing efforts to support your digital transformation journey, we are excited to assist you in transitioning from traditional on-premises infrastructure to a more scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud environment.

This move offers several benefits, including:

Enhanced scalability and flexibility

Improved security posture

Cost optimization through pay-as-you-go models

Faster deployment and innovation cycles

the ingress path from external SFTP clients to the NIS SFTP server:

SFTP Client Ingress Path to NIS SFTP Server
To ensure secure, scalable, and reliable access, incoming SFTP traffic from external clients to the NIS SFTP server follows a multi-layered ingress architecture. Here's how the flow works:

1. SFTP Client Connection Initiation
External SFTP clients initiate a connection to a public DNS name (e.g., sftp.customer-domain.com) that is managed via Amazon Route 53.

This DNS entry is mapped to an Akamai Edge endpoint, ensuring global traffic optimization and DDoS protection.

2. Akamai Edge Security & Routing
Akamai acts as the first line of defense, providing:

TLS termination and re-encryption (if enabled)

Bot protection and geo-filtering (if configured)

Caching and acceleration (if applicable)

Akamai then forwards the traffic to the next hop within the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) via a secure and predefined route.

3. DMZ Layer (Network Isolation & Inspection)
The traffic lands in the DMZ, which serves as a buffer zone between the external network (internet) and internal systems.

Here, firewalls and inspection tools verify and log incoming sessions for compliance and threat detection.

Only whitelisted ports (typically TCP 22 for SFTP) and IP addresses are allowed to proceed.

4. Routing to Internal NIS SFTP Server
Once validated, the traffic is routed to the NIS-hosted SFTP server (e.g., AWS Transfer Family or a managed EC2-based SFTP endpoint).

This endpoint resides in a private subnet, protected by security groups and IAM roles, and is not directly accessible from the public internet.

Route 53 Private Hosted Zones (or VPC-specific endpoints) help route the traffic internally as needed for high availability and failover.

Key Benefits of This Architecture
Security: Multi-layer protection through Akamai, DMZ firewalls, and internal access control.

Scalability: Akamai offloads load and distributes traffic efficiently.

Resilience: DNS-based routing via Route 53 allows for disaster recovery and regional failover.
