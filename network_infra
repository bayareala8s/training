Here are some sample comments you can add to the Architecture Excel sheet to confirm the feasibility of the file transfer from **SourceApp** to **TargetApp**:

1. **General Feasibility Confirmation:**
   - *The architecture supports seamless file transfer between SourceApp and TargetApp based on the defined integration points and protocols.*

2. **Source and Target Validation:**
   - *SourceApp and TargetApp are compatible for file transfer as per the architecture's supported file formats, transfer methods (e.g., SFTP, HTTPS), and security protocols.*

3. **File Transfer Protocol:**
   - *File transfer will utilize [specific protocol, e.g., SFTP or HTTPS], which ensures secure and reliable data transmission between SourceApp and TargetApp.*

4. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - *Authentication mechanisms between SourceApp and TargetApp are implemented via [e.g., API keys, IAM roles, or certificates], ensuring secure access during file transfer.*

5. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - *The architecture includes logging and monitoring for all file transfer activities to ensure visibility and troubleshooting capabilities.*

6. **Performance Considerations:**
   - *The file transfer process between SourceApp and TargetApp is optimized for performance, supporting the defined file size and transfer frequency requirements.*

7. **Error Handling:**
   - *Error handling mechanisms are in place to handle failures in file transfer and retry the operation as necessary.*

8. **Scalability:**
   - *The architecture is scalable, supporting increased data volumes and file transfer frequency as per the application's growth needs.*

9. **Data Integrity:**
   - *Data integrity is ensured using checksum validation during the transfer process between SourceApp and TargetApp.*
