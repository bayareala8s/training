Sure! Here is a detailed implementation of a stack in Python using a custom class, complete with comments to explain each part of the code.

```python
class Node:
    """
    Class to represent a node in the stack.
    Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node.
    """
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None


class Stack:
    """
    Class to represent the stack data structure.
    The stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize an empty stack.
        The top attribute points to the top node in the stack.
        The count attribute keeps track of the number of elements in the stack.
        """
        self.top = None
        self.count = 0

    def push(self, item):
        """
        Add an item to the top of the stack.
        
        :param item: The item to be added to the stack.
        """
        new_node = Node(item)  # Create a new node with the given item
        new_node.next = self.top  # Make the new node point to the current top node
        self.top = new_node  # Update the top to be the new node
        self.count += 1  # Increment the count of elements

    def pop(self):
        """
        Remove and return the top item from the stack.
        
        :return: The value of the top item in the stack.
        :raises IndexError: If the stack is empty.
        """
        if not self.is_empty():
            popped_value = self.top.value  # Get the value of the top item
            self.top = self.top.next  # Update the top to the next node
            self.count -= 1  # Decrement the count of elements
            return popped_value
        raise IndexError("pop from empty stack")  # Raise an error if the stack is empty

    def peek(self):
        """
        Return the top item from the stack without removing it.
        
        :return: The value of the top item in the stack.
        :raises IndexError: If the stack is empty.
        """
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.top.value  # Return the value of the top item
        raise IndexError("peek from empty stack")  # Raise an error if the stack is empty

    def is_empty(self):
        """
        Check if the stack is empty.
        
        :return: True if the stack is empty, False otherwise.
        """
        return self.top is None  # Return True if top is None, indicating the stack is empty

    def size(self):
        """
        Return the number of items in the stack.
        
        :return: The number of items in the stack.
        """
        return self.count  # Return the count of elements


# Example usage of the Stack class
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Stack()
    s.push(1)
    s.push(2)
    s.push(3)
    print(s.pop())    # Output: 3
    print(s.peek())   # Output: 2
    print(s.size())   # Output: 2
    print(s.is_empty())  # Output: False
    s.pop()
    s.pop()
    print(s.is_empty())  # Output: True
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node Class**:
   - Represents a node in the stack with a value and a reference to the next node.
   - `__init__(self, value)`: Initializes the node with a given value and sets the next reference to `None`.

2. **Stack Class**:
   - Represents the stack itself.
   - `__init__(self)`: Initializes an empty stack with `top` set to `None` and `count` set to 0.
   - `push(self, item)`: Adds a new item to the top of the stack. Creates a new node, updates the `top`, and increments the count.
   - `pop(self)`: Removes and returns the top item from the stack. Updates the `top` and decrements the count. Raises an `IndexError` if the stack is empty.
   - `peek(self)`: Returns the top item without removing it. Raises an `IndexError` if the stack is empty.
   - `is_empty(self)`: Checks if the stack is empty by checking if `top` is `None`.
   - `size(self)`: Returns the number of items in the stack by returning the count.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - Demonstrates how to use the `Stack` class by pushing, popping, peeking, and checking the size and emptiness of the stack.
