Sure! Below is a step-by-step Terraform script to set up AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch. This script will create a CloudTrail to log API activities and configure CloudWatch to monitor specific metrics and set up alarms.

### Step 1: Define Providers and Variables

Create a file named `main.tf` for defining the AWS provider and any necessary variables.

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Define variables
variable "trail_name" {
  description = "The name of the CloudTrail trail"
  default     = "my-cloudtrail"
}

variable "s3_bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket to store CloudTrail logs"
  default     = "my-cloudtrail-logs-bucket"
}

variable "alarm_cpu_threshold" {
  description = "CPU Utilization threshold for the alarm"
  default     = 80
}
```

### Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket for CloudTrail Logs

Add a new file named `s3.tf` to create an S3 bucket.

```hcl
# s3.tf

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "cloudtrail_logs" {
  bucket = var.s3_bucket_name

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }

  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        sse_algorithm = "AES256"
      }
    }
  }

  lifecycle_rule {
    enabled = true
    prefix  = "logs/"
    expiration {
      days = 90
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Create a CloudTrail

Add a new file named `cloudtrail.tf` to create a CloudTrail.

```hcl
# cloudtrail.tf

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "main" {
  name                          = var.trail_name
  s3_bucket_name                = aws_s3_bucket.cloudtrail_logs.bucket
  include_global_service_events = true
  is_multi_region_trail         = true
  enable_logging                = true

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::S3::Object"
