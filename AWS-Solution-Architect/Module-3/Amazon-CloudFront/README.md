## Amazon CloudFront Detailed Guide

### Introduction to Amazon CloudFront

Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. It integrates with other AWS services to provide an easy-to-use and cost-effective way to distribute content.

### Key Features of Amazon CloudFront

- **Global Distribution**: CloudFront has a global network of edge locations to ensure low latency and high performance.
- **Security**: CloudFront integrates with AWS Shield, AWS WAF, and AWS Certificate Manager to provide robust security for your applications.
- **Programmability**: Lambda@Edge allows you to run code closer to users of your application, enabling real-time customization.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model helps to control costs.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works seamlessly with other AWS services like S3, EC2, and Route 53.

### Setting Up Amazon CloudFront

#### Step 1: Creating a CloudFront Distribution

1. **Login to AWS Management Console**: Navigate to the CloudFront service.
2. **Create Distribution**:
   - Select the type of distribution: `Web` or `RTMP`. For this guide, we'll focus on `Web`.
   - Click on "Create Distribution" under the Web section.

#### Step 2: Configuring the Distribution

1. **Origin Settings**:
   - **Origin Domain Name**: The domain name of the origin (e.g., your S3 bucket or web server).
   - **Origin Path**: Optional path to append to the origin domain name.
   - **Origin ID**: A unique identifier for the origin.

2. **Default Cache Behavior Settings**:
   - **Viewer Protocol Policy**: Choose between HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Allowed HTTP Methods**: Select the HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE).
   - **Cache Based on Selected Request Headers**: Choose how CloudFront caches content based on request headers.

3. **Distribution Settings**:
   - **Price Class**: Select the regions where you want CloudFront to distribute your content.
   - **AWS WAF Web ACL**: Attach a Web ACL to the distribution for additional security.
   - **Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)**: Add custom domain names if necessary.
   - **SSL Certificate**: Choose between default CloudFront SSL certificate or a custom certificate.

4. **Create Distribution**: Review the settings and click on "Create Distribution".

#### Step 3: Configuring Your Origin

- **Amazon S3**: Ensure your bucket policies allow CloudFront to access the content.
- **Custom Origin (e.g., EC2)**: Ensure your server is configured to handle requests from CloudFront.

#### Step 4: Testing Your Distribution

- Once the distribution status changes to "Deployed", test it by accessing the CloudFront domain name in a web browser.
- Verify that the content is served correctly and check the headers to ensure caching is working as expected.

### Advanced Configuration

#### Caching Strategies

- **Cache Invalidation**: Use invalidation requests to remove objects from CloudFront edge caches before they expire.
- **TTL Settings**: Configure Time-to-Live (TTL) settings to control how long objects are cached.

#### Security

- **HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted in transit.
- **Access Control**: Use signed URLs and signed cookies to restrict access to content.
- **AWS WAF**: Configure rules in AWS WAF to protect against common web exploits.

#### Monitoring and Logging

- **CloudFront Access Logs**: Enable logging to capture detailed information about every user request.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Use CloudWatch metrics to monitor CloudFront performance and set up alarms for specific events.

### Real-World Example: E-Commerce Site

#### Scenario

An e-commerce company wants to use CloudFront to distribute its website content globally, ensuring high availability, security, and scalability.

#### Steps

1. **Create an S3 Bucket for Static Content**: Store images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. **Set Up CloudFront Distribution**:
   - Origin: S3 bucket and web servers.
   - Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
   - Enable Caching and Configure TTL.
3. **Configure SSL**: Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a custom SSL certificate.
4. **Security**:
   - Enable AWS WAF to protect against SQL injection and XSS.
   - Use signed URLs for sensitive content.
5. **Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch alarms for metrics like 4xx and 5xx errors.

#### Terraform Script Example

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-ecommerce-content"
  acl    = "public-read"

  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"
  }
}

resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "my_distribution" {
  origin {
    domain_name = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.bucket_regional_domain_name
    origin_id   = "myS3Origin"
  }

  enabled             = true
  is_ipv6_enabled     = true
  default_root_object = "index.html"

  default_cache_behavior {
    target_origin_id       = "myS3Origin"
    viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"

    allowed_methods = ["GET", "HEAD"]
    cached_methods  = ["GET", "HEAD"]

    forwarded_values {
      query_string = false
      cookies {
        forward = "none"
      }
    }

    min_ttl                = 0
    default_ttl            = 86400
    max_ttl                = 31536000
  }

  price_class = "PriceClass_100"

  restrictions {
    geo_restriction {
      restriction_type = "none"
    }
  }

  viewer_certificate {
    cloudfront_default_certificate = true
  }
}
```
