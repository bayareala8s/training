**Solution:**
- **Frontend:** React.js hosted on Amazon S3 and served via Amazon CloudFront.
- **Backend:** AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB.

**Steps:**
1. **Create API Gateway:**
   - Define a REST API for the application.
   - Create resources and methods for handling tasks (e.g., `/tasks` with methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

2. **Integrate with Lambda:**
   - Use Lambda functions to handle the business logic for each method (e.g., fetching tasks, creating tasks).
   - Connect API Gateway methods to the corresponding Lambda functions.

3. **Database Setup:**
   - Use DynamoDB to store task data.
   - Lambda functions interact with DynamoDB to perform CRUD operations.

4. **Deploy and Secure:**
