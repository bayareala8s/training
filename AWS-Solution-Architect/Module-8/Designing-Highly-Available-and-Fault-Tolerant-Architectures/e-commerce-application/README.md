This is a Terraform script that sets up an AWS infrastructure for an e-commerce application. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Provider Configuration**: It sets up AWS as the cloud provider and specifies the region as `us-west-2`.

2. **VPC Creation**: It creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a CIDR block of `10.0.0.0/16`.

3. **Internet Gateway**: It creates an Internet Gateway and attaches it to the VPC.

4. **Elastic IP and NAT Gateway**: It allocates an Elastic IP and creates a NAT Gateway in the first public subnet.

5. **Subnets**: It creates two public and two private subnets in different availability zones within the VPC.

6. **Route Tables**: It creates a route table for public subnets and associates it with the Internet Gateway. It also creates a route table for private subnets and associates it with the NAT Gateway.

7. **Security Groups**: It creates security groups for the Application Load Balancer (ALB), the ECS tasks, and the RDS instance.

8. **RDS Instance**: It creates a PostgreSQL RDS instance with a custom parameter group.

9. **IAM Role**: It creates an IAM role for ECS task execution.

10. **ECS Cluster and Task Definition**: It creates an ECS cluster, an ECR repository, a CloudWatch log group, and defines an ECS task.

11. **ECS Service**: It creates an ECS service that runs the defined task.

12. **Load Balancer**: It creates an Application Load Balancer, a target group, and a listener for the load balancer.

The script uses the Fargate launch type for ECS, which means that AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, and you only need to worry about the tasks themselves. The application is expected to be a Node.js app that listens on port 3000 and connects to a PostgreSQL database.
