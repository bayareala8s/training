The provided Terraform script sets up a robust and scalable infrastructure on AWS for an e-commerce application. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key components and their roles:

1. **Provider Configuration**:
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }
   ```

2. **VPC and Subnets**:
   - Creates a VPC with a CIDR block of `10.0.0.0/16`.
   - Sets up two public subnets and two private subnets in different availability zones.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
     cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
   }
   ```

3. **Internet and NAT Gateway**:
   - Internet Gateway for public internet access.
   - NAT Gateway for allowing instances in private subnets to access the internet.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_internet_gateway" "main" {
     vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
   }
   ```

4. **Elastic IP and Subnets**:
   - Allocates an Elastic IP for the NAT Gateway.
   - Defines public and private subnets.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_eip" "main" {
     domain = "vpc"
   }
   ```

5. **Route Tables**:
   - Route tables for public and private subnets.
   - Routes for internet traffic and NAT Gateway.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_route_table" "public" {
     vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

     route {
       cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
       gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.main.id
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Security Groups**:
   - Security groups for ALB, ECS tasks, and RDS instance.
   - Manages inbound and outbound traffic rules.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_security_group" "alb" {
     vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

     ingress {
       from_port   = 80
       to_port     = 80
       protocol    = "tcp"
       cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
     }

     egress {
       from_port   = 0
       to_port     = 0
       protocol    = "-1"
       cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
     }
   }
   ```

7. **RDS Database**:
   - Custom parameter group for PostgreSQL.
   - PostgreSQL RDS instance in private subnets.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_db_instance" "postgres" {
     allocated_storage    = 20
     engine               = "postgres"
     instance_class       = "db.t3.micro"
     db_name              = "ecommerce"
     username             = "postgres"
     password             = "your-password"
     skip_final_snapshot  = true
     vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.rds.id]
     db_subnet_group_name = aws_db_subnet_group.main.name
     multi_az             = false
   }
   ```

8. **IAM Role for ECS**:
   - IAM role for ECS task execution with necessary policies.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_iam_role" "ecs_task_execution" {
     name = "ecsTaskExecutionRole"

     assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
       Version = "2012-10-17"
       Statement = [
         {
           Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
           Effect = "Allow"
           Principal = {
             Service = "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
           }
         }
       ]
     })

     managed_policy_arns = [
       "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy",
       "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsFullAccess",
     ]
   }
   ```

9. **ECS Cluster and Services**:
   - ECS cluster and task definition.
   - ECS service with Fargate launch type.
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
     name = "ecommerce-cluster"
   }
   ```

10. **Load Balancer and Target Group**:
    - Application Load Balancer with a listener.
    - Target group for routing traffic to ECS tasks.
    ```hcl
    resource "aws_lb" "main" {
      name               = "ecommerce-lb"
      internal           = false
      load_balancer_type = "application"
      security_groups    = [aws_security_group.alb.id]
      subnets            = aws_subnet.public[*].id
    }
    ```

This setup ensures high availability, security, and scalability for the e-commerce application. If you need further customization or have any specific requirements, feel free to ask!
