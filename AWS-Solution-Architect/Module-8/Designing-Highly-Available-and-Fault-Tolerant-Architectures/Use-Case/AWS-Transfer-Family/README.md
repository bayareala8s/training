Implementing high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) for AWS Transfer Family involves a combination of architectural best practices, configuration settings, and AWS services. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### High Availability (HA) Implementation

1. **Deploy AWS Transfer Family in Multiple Availability Zones (AZs):**
   - Ensure that your Transfer Family server is deployed in multiple AZs to avoid single points of failure.

2. **Use Route 53 for DNS Failover:**
   - **Create a Route 53 Hosted Zone:**
     - Go to the Route 53 console and create a hosted zone.
     - Add DNS records for your Transfer Family server.
   - **Set Up Health Checks:**
     - Configure health checks to monitor the health of your Transfer Family endpoints.
   - **Configure DNS Failover:**
     - Create failover routing policies to automatically redirect traffic to healthy endpoints.

3. **Leverage Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):**
   - **Set Up a Network Load Balancer (NLB):**
     - Create an NLB to distribute traffic across multiple AZs.
   - **Configure Listener Rules:**
     - Set up listener rules to forward traffic to your Transfer Family endpoints.

4. **Use Auto Scaling for Underlying Infrastructure:**
   - **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG):**
     - Create ASGs for the EC2 instances underlying your Transfer Family server.
   - **Configure Scaling Policies:**
     - Define scaling policies to adjust the number of instances based on demand.

5. **Monitor with CloudWatch:**
   - **Set Up CloudWatch Alarms:**
     - Monitor key metrics such as connection counts, error counts, and transfer rates.
   - **Enable Detailed Monitoring:**
     - Enable detailed monitoring for your resources to get more granular data.

### Disaster Recovery (DR) Implementation

1. **Cross-Region Replication for S3 Buckets:**
   - **Enable S3 Cross-Region Replication:**
     - Go to the S3 console and enable cross-region replication for your buckets.
     - Choose a destination bucket in a different region and configure the replication rules.

2. **Set Up Multi-Region Transfer Family Servers:**
   - **Deploy Transfer Family Servers in Multiple Regions:**
     - Set up Transfer Family servers in different regions to ensure availability in case of a regional outage.
   - **Synchronize User Data and Configurations:**
     - Use automation scripts or AWS CloudFormation to replicate user configurations across regions.

3. **Use Route 53 for Multi-Region Failover:**
   - **Create Multi-Region DNS Records:**
     - In Route 53, create DNS records that point to your Transfer Family servers in different regions.
   - **Configure Geolocation Routing:**
     - Set up geolocation routing to direct users to the nearest available Transfer Family server.

4. **Automate Failover with AWS Lambda:**
   - **Create Lambda Functions:**
     - Develop Lambda functions to monitor the health of your Transfer Family servers and automatically update Route 53 records in case of failures.
   - **Set Up Event Triggers:**
     - Configure CloudWatch events to trigger Lambda functions based on health check results or specific metrics.

5. **Implement Backup and Restore Procedures:**
   - **Regular Backups:**
     - Schedule regular backups of your S3 buckets and Transfer Family configurations.
   - **Automated Restores:**
     - Develop scripts to automate the restoration process in case of a disaster.

Below is a detailed Terraform script to set up an AWS Transfer Family server with high availability and disaster recovery features, leveraging Route 53, Network Load Balancer (NLB), S3 cross-region replication, and CloudWatch monitoring.

### Step 1: Set Up AWS Transfer Family Server

```hcl
# providers.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# main.tf
resource "aws_transfer_server" "transfer_family" {
  endpoint_type = "PUBLIC"
  identity_provider_type = "SERVICE_MANAGED"
  logging_role   = aws_iam_role.transfer_family_logging.arn
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "transfer_family_logging" {
  name = "transfer_family_logging_role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole",
      Effect = "Allow",
      Principal = {
        Service = "transfer.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "transfer_family_logging_policy" {
  name   = "transfer_family_logging_policy"
  role   = aws_iam_role.transfer_family_logging.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Action = [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl"
      ],
      Effect   = "Allow",
      Resource = "arn:aws:s3:::my-transfer-family-logs/*"
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "transfer_family_logs" {
  bucket = "my-transfer-family-logs"
}

resource "aws_transfer_user" "transfer_family_user" {
  server_id       = aws_transfer_server.transfer_family.id
  user_name       = "myuser"
  role            = aws_iam_role.transfer_family_user.arn
  home_directory  = "/myuser"
  ssh_public_key_body = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "transfer_family_user" {
  name = "transfer_family_user_role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole",
      Effect = "Allow",
      Principal = {
        Service = "transfer.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "transfer_family_user_policy" {
  name   = "transfer_family_user_policy"
  role   = aws_iam_role.transfer_family_user.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Action = [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      Effect   = "Allow",
      Resource = [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-transfer-family-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-transfer-family-bucket/*"
      ]
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "transfer_family_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-transfer-family-bucket"
}
```

### Step 2: Set Up Network Load Balancer (NLB)

```hcl
# network.tf
resource "aws_lb" "transfer_family_nlb" {
  name               = "transfer-family-nlb"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "network"
  enable_deletion_protection = true

  dynamic "subnet_mapping" {
    for_each = aws_subnet.transfer_family_subnets
    content {
      subnet_id = subnet_mapping.value.id
    }
  }

  enable_cross_zone_load_balancing = true

  depends_on = [aws_transfer_server.transfer_family]
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group" "transfer_family_tg" {
  name        = "transfer-family-tg"
  port        = 22
  protocol    = "TCP"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id
  target_type = "ip"
  health_check {
    protocol = "TCP"
    port     = "22"
  }
}

resource "aws_lb_listener" "transfer_family_listener" {
  load_balancer_arn = aws_lb.transfer_family_nlb.arn
  port              = "22"
  protocol          = "TCP"

  default_action {
    type             = "forward"
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.transfer_family_tg.arn
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Configure Route 53 for DNS Failover

```hcl
# route53.tf
resource "aws_route53_zone" "transfer_family_zone" {
  name = "example.com"
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "transfer_family" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.transfer_family_zone.zone_id
  name    = "transfer-family"
  type    = "A"

  alias {
    name                   = aws_lb.transfer_family_nlb.dns_name
    zone_id                = aws_lb.transfer_family_nlb.zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }
}

resource "aws_route53_health_check" "transfer_family_health_check" {
  fqdn             = "transfer-family.example.com"
  port             = 22
  type             = "TCP"
  resource_path    = "/"
  failure_threshold = 3
}
```

### Step 4: Enable Cross-Region Replication for S3

```hcl
# replication.tf
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "primary"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "secondary"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "primary" {
  provider = "aws.primary"
  bucket   = "my-transfer-family-bucket"
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "secondary" {
  provider = "aws.secondary"
  bucket   = "my-transfer-family-bucket-replica"
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration" "replication" {
  provider = "aws.primary"
  bucket   = aws_s3_bucket.primary.bucket

  role = aws_iam_role.replication.arn

  rules {
    id     = "replication"
    prefix = ""
    status = "Enabled"

    destination {
      bucket        = aws_s3_bucket.secondary.arn
      storage_class = "STANDARD"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "replication" {
  name = "replication_role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole",
      Effect = "Allow",
      Principal = {
        Service = "s3.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "replication_policy" {
  role   = aws_iam_role.replication.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Action = [
        "s3:ReplicateObject",
        "s3:ReplicateDelete",
        "s3:ReplicateTags",
        "s3:GetObjectVersion",
        "s3:GetObjectVersionAcl",
        "s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication",
        "s3:GetObjectVersionTagging",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      Effect   = "Allow",
      Resource = [
        aws_s3_bucket.primary.arn,
        "${aws_s3_bucket.primary.arn}/*",
        aws_s3_bucket.secondary.arn,
        "${aws_s3_bucket.secondary.arn}/*"
      ]
    }]
  })
}
```

### Step 5: Monitoring and Alarms with CloudWatch

```hcl
# cloudwatch.tf
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "transfer_family_logs" {
  name = "/aws/transfer/my-transfer-family"
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_stream" "transfer_family_log_stream" {
  name           = "transfer_family_log_stream"
  log_group_name = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.transfer_family_logs.name
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "transfer_family_errors" {
  alarm_name          = "TransferFamilyErrors"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "1"
  metric_name         = "Errors"
  namespace           = "AWS/Transfer"
  period              = "60"
  statistic           = "Sum"
  threshold           = "1"

  alarm_actions = [aws_sns_topic.transfer_family_alarm_topic.arn]
}

resource "aws_sns_topic" "transfer_family_alarm_topic" {
  name = "transfer_family_alarm_topic"
}

resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "transfer_family_subscription" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.transfer_family_alarm_topic.arn
  protocol  = "email"
  endpoint  = "my-email@example.com"
}
```

### Step 6: Automate Failover with Lambda (Optional)

This step involves creating Lambda functions to monitor Transfer Family health and update Route 53 records. The detailed implementation of Lambda functions would require additional setup and is optional for a basic HA and DR setup.

### Final Steps

1. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Validate the Configuration:**
   ```sh
   terraform validate
   ```

3. **Apply the Configuration:**
   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

By following these steps and using the provided Terraform scripts, you can set up a highly available and disaster-resilient AWS Transfer Family environment.
