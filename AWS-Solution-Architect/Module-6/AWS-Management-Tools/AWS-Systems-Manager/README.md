   - Install the SSM agent on your instances if itâ€™s not already pre-installed.

2. **Initial Configuration**:
   - Explore the Systems Manager console to familiarize yourself with its features.
   - Configure Inventory and enable data collection from your instances.

3. **Create Baseline Documents**:
   - Start by creating baseline automation documents and parameter stores.
   - Define patch baselines and schedule initial patching operations.

4. **Scale Operations**:
   - Gradually expand the use of Systems Manager features across your AWS environment.
   - Integrate with other AWS services such as CloudWatch, Config, and AWS Support for a cohesive management experience.

By leveraging AWS Systems Manager, you can enhance the operational efficiency, security, and compliance of your AWS environment, while reducing manual intervention and the risk of errors.




## Practical Use Case: Automated Patch Management with AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager

### Objective

To ensure that all instances within an AWS environment are regularly updated with the latest security and software patches automatically, thereby maintaining compliance and security.

### Steps to Implement Automated Patch Management

#### 1. Configure Patch Baselines

**Purpose**: Define which patches are approved for deployment.

- **Steps**:
  1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console.
  2. In the navigation pane, choose **Patch Manager**.
  3. Choose **Create patch baseline**.
  4. Enter a name and description for your patch baseline.
  5. Specify the operating system (Windows or Linux).
  6. Define the rules for approving patches (e.g., automatically approve critical and security patches within 7 days of release).
  7. Optionally, add any patch exceptions or additional rules.
  8. Choose **Create baseline**.

#### 2. Define Patch Groups

**Purpose**: Organize instances into logical groups for patching.

- **Steps**:
  1. Create a tag for your instances, e.g., `PatchGroup=WebServers`.
  2. Assign the tag to the instances you want to include in the patch group.
  3. In the Systems Manager console, choose **Patch Manager**.
  4. Choose the patch baseline you created.
  5. Under **Patch groups**, choose **Add patch group**.
  6. Enter the patch group name (the tag value, e.g., `WebServers`).
