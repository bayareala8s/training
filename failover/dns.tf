### Architecture for AWS File Transfer Services to Connect to External SFTP Servers and Drop Files to Target Systems Using AWS Lambda

Here is a detailed architecture and workflow for implementing AWS File Transfer services to connect to external SFTP servers, process the files, and drop them into target systems with AWS Lambda.

---

### **1. Architecture Diagram**

The architecture involves the following AWS services:
- **AWS Transfer Family (for SFTP)**
- **Amazon S3**
- **AWS Lambda**
- **Amazon CloudWatch**
- **Amazon SNS (Optional, for notifications)**
- **Target System (Amazon S3, Database, or another service)**

---

### **2. Workflow Description**

1. **SFTP Server Setup (AWS Transfer Family):**
   - Configure AWS Transfer Family to serve as an SFTP endpoint.
   - The endpoint will receive files from external systems and store them in an Amazon S3 bucket.
   - Create IAM roles and policies to control access to the S3 bucket for specific SFTP users.

2. **Amazon S3 Storage:**
   - Files uploaded to the SFTP server are stored in a dedicated S3 bucket.
   - Organize the S3 bucket into folders (e.g., `/inbound` for incoming files, `/processed` for processed files).

3. **S3 Event Trigger:**
   - Configure an S3 Event Notification to trigger an AWS Lambda function whenever a file is uploaded to the `/inbound` folder.

4. **AWS Lambda for Processing:**
   - Lambda reads the uploaded file from the S3 bucket.
   - Perform necessary processing or transformation on the file, such as:
     - Decrypting the file
     - Validating the file format or structure
     - Converting the file to a required format (e.g., CSV to JSON)
   - Connect to external SFTP servers using Python libraries like `paramiko` for further processing if needed.

5. **File Transfer to Target System:**
   - Based on the file content or metadata, the Lambda function decides where to route the file:
     - Copy to another S3 bucket (target system bucket).
     - Insert data into a database (e.g., Amazon RDS or DynamoDB).
     - Forward the file to an API endpoint or another system.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to capture errors and execution details from the Lambda function.
   - Implement retries or error notifications using Amazon SNS or CloudWatch Alarms.

7. **Archiving and Cleanup:**
   - After processing, move the original files from the `/inbound` folder to an `/archive` or `/processed` folder within the S3 bucket for record-keeping.
   - Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to delete archived files after a specific period.

---

### **3. Detailed Steps for Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Configure AWS Transfer Family**
- Create a new AWS Transfer Family server for SFTP.
- Define an S3 bucket as the backend storage for the SFTP server.
- Set up user authentication (e.g., Service Managed, Active Directory, or Custom Identity Provider).

#### **Step 2: Set Up S3 Bucket and Folder Structure**
- Create a bucket with folders like `/inbound`, `/processed`, and `/archive`.
- Apply IAM policies to restrict access to the bucket and specific prefixes.

#### **Step 3: Lambda Function for Processing**
- Use the AWS SDK (`boto3`) for file operations in S3.
- Use `paramiko` for connecting to external SFTP servers if additional file transfer is required.
- Implement file transformation logic.
- Example code snippet:

```python
import boto3
import paramiko

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    
    # Extract S3 bucket and file information from the event
    bucket_name = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    object_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    
    # Download file from S3
    file_path = f'/tmp/{object_key.split("/")[-1]}'
    s3.download_file(bucket_name, object_key, file_path)
    
    # (Optional) Process the file (e.g., decrypt, validate)
    # ...
    
    # Connect to external SFTP server
    sftp_host = "external-sftp-server.com"
    sftp_user = "username"
    sftp_key = "/path/to/private/key"
    transport = paramiko.Transport((sftp_host, 22))
    transport.connect(username=sftp_user, pkey=paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file(sftp_key))
    sftp = paramiko.SFTPClient.from_transport(transport)
    
    # Upload file to external SFTP server
    sftp.put(file_path, f"/remote/path/{object_key.split('/')[-1]}")
    sftp.close()
    
    # Copy processed file to the target system (e.g., another S3 bucket)
    target_bucket = "target-system-bucket"
    s3.copy_object(
        Bucket=target_bucket,
        CopySource={'Bucket': bucket_name, 'Key': object_key},
        Key=f"processed/{object_key.split('/')[-1]}"
    )
    
    # Archive original file
    s3.copy_object(
        Bucket=bucket_name,
        CopySource={'Bucket': bucket_name, 'Key': object_key},
        Key=f"archive/{object_key.split('/')[-1]}"
    )
    s3.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object_key)
    
    return {"status": "File processed successfully"}
```

#### **Step 4: Monitoring and Alerting**
- Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor Lambda execution and set alarms for failed executions.
- Configure Amazon SNS for email or SMS notifications on errors.

#### **Step 5: Automation and Scalability**
- Use AWS Step Functions for complex workflows involving multiple Lambda functions.
- Scale using Lambda concurrency and S3 event notifications.

### **4. Benefits**
- **Serverless and Cost-Effective:** Leverages serverless AWS services to minimize infrastructure costs.
- **Highly Scalable:** Automatically handles varying file loads.
- **Secure:** AWS Transfer Family provides secure SFTP access, and S3 bucket policies ensure restricted access.

### **Workflow for AWS File Transfer Services to Connect to External SFTP Servers and Drop Files to Target Systems**

---

### **Step-by-Step Workflow**

#### **1. File Transfer from External Source to AWS Transfer Family**
1. External systems upload files to the AWS Transfer Family SFTP server.
2. AWS Transfer Family securely writes the files into a designated Amazon S3 bucket (e.g., `/inbound` folder).

#### **2. S3 Event Notification**
1. Configure the S3 bucket to send event notifications (e.g., `s3:ObjectCreated:*`) for the `/inbound` folder.
2. These notifications trigger an AWS Lambda function to start the file processing.

#### **3. AWS Lambda Function for File Processing**
1. **Input File Fetching:**
   - Lambda retrieves the file details (bucket name and file key) from the S3 event.
   - Downloads the file to the Lambda `/tmp` directory.
   
2. **File Processing:**
   - Perform required operations on the file, such as:
     - **Validation:** Check the file format, size, or structure.
     - **Transformation:** Convert file formats (e.g., CSV to JSON).
     - **Decryption/Decompression:** If needed, decrypt or decompress the file.
   
3. **File Transfer to External SFTP (Optional):**
   - Use a Python library like `paramiko` to connect to an external SFTP server.
   - Upload the processed file to the external SFTP server (if required).

4. **File Transfer to Target System:**
   - Based on business logic, transfer the file to the appropriate target system:
     - Copy the file to another Amazon S3 bucket (e.g., `/target` folder in a different bucket).
     - Insert the fileâ€™s data into a database (e.g., Amazon RDS or DynamoDB).
     - Forward the file to an API endpoint for further processing.

5. **Logging and Error Handling:**
   - Log execution details and errors using Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
   - Retry on transient errors or notify the operations team using Amazon SNS.

#### **4. Post-Processing: File Archiving and Cleanup**
1. After successful processing, move the original file from `/inbound` to the `/archive` folder in the S3 bucket.
2. Configure an S3 lifecycle policy to delete archived files after a retention period (e.g., 30 days).

---

### **High-Level Steps**

1. **Set up AWS Transfer Family:**
   - Configure an SFTP server with an Amazon S3 bucket as the backend.

2. **Configure S3 Bucket:**
   - Create folders for organizing files (`/inbound`, `/processed`, `/archive`).
   - Set IAM roles and policies for controlled access.

3. **Enable S3 Event Notifications:**
   - Trigger a Lambda function on `s3:ObjectCreated:*` events in the `/inbound` folder.

4. **Develop AWS Lambda Function:**
   - Write code to process files:
     - Fetch files from S3.
     - Process, transform, or validate files.
     - Transfer files to external SFTP or target systems.

5. **Set Up Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Use CloudWatch to monitor Lambda execution.
   - Create alarms for failures and notify teams using SNS.

6. **Implement File Archiving and Retention:**
   - Move processed files to `/archive` and automate cleanup using lifecycle policies.

To include **failover** between the **primary region (us-west)** and the **secondary region (us-east)**, you can modify the architecture to ensure high availability and disaster recovery. Below is a step-by-step workflow for implementing failover capabilities.

---

### **Enhanced Workflow with Failover**

---

#### **1. Setup Primary and Secondary Regions**
1. **Primary Region (us-west):**
   - Configure AWS Transfer Family in **us-west**.
   - Store SFTP files in the **primary S3 bucket** in us-west (e.g., `s3://primary-bucket/inbound`).
   - Set up the primary AWS Lambda function in us-west for file processing.

2. **Secondary Region (us-east):**
   - Configure AWS Transfer Family in **us-east** for failover.
   - Store SFTP files in the **secondary S3 bucket** in us-east (e.g., `s3://secondary-bucket/inbound`).
   - Set up a secondary AWS Lambda function in us-east for processing.

---

#### **2. Synchronize Data Between Regions**
1. **Enable S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR):**
   - Replicate the primary S3 bucket (us-west) to the secondary S3 bucket (us-east).
   - CRR ensures that all files uploaded to the primary bucket are automatically copied to the secondary bucket.

2. **Use S3 Versioning:**
   - Enable versioning on both the primary and secondary S3 buckets to avoid data loss and ensure file consistency.

---

#### **3. Event Notifications for Both Regions**
1. **Primary Region (us-west):**
   - Configure S3 event notifications in the primary bucket to trigger the primary Lambda function for file processing.
2. **Secondary Region (us-east):**
   - Configure S3 event notifications in the secondary bucket to trigger the secondary Lambda function during a failover.

---

#### **4. Add Failover Mechanism**
1. **Monitor Primary Services:**
   - Use Amazon Route 53 health checks or Amazon CloudWatch Alarms to monitor the health of:
     - AWS Transfer Family in us-west.
     - Lambda function and other processing components in us-west.

2. **Route 53 DNS Failover:**
   - Configure Route 53 to route traffic between us-west and us-east.
   - Use health checks to detect issues with the SFTP endpoint in us-west and automatically failover to us-east.

3. **Secondary Processing:**
   - In case of a failure in the primary region:
     - Files replicated to the secondary bucket in us-east will trigger the secondary Lambda function for processing.
     - The secondary region handles file processing and target system transfer.

---

#### **5. Workflow With Failover**

1. **Normal Operations (us-west):**
   - Files are uploaded to AWS Transfer Family in us-west.
   - Files are stored in the primary S3 bucket.
   - Lambda function in us-west processes files and transfers them to target systems.
   - Files are replicated to the secondary S3 bucket in us-east for redundancy.

2. **Failover Operations (us-east):**
   - If a failure is detected in us-west, Route 53 routes traffic to the us-east SFTP endpoint.
   - Files are uploaded to AWS Transfer Family in us-east.
   - Files stored in the secondary S3 bucket trigger the secondary Lambda function for processing.
   - Secondary region processes files and transfers them to target systems.

---

### **6. Diagram Representation**

The architecture would look like this:
- **Primary Region (us-west):**
  - AWS Transfer Family â†’ S3 Bucket â†’ Lambda â†’ Target System.
  - CRR replicates files to the secondary bucket.
- **Secondary Region (us-east):**
  - AWS Transfer Family â†’ S3 Bucket â†’ Lambda (active during failover) â†’ Target System.

---

### **7. High Availability and Disaster Recovery Considerations**
1. **Automated Failover:**
   - Use Route 53 health checks to ensure seamless DNS-based failover between regions.
2. **Data Consistency:**
   - Cross-Region Replication ensures files are available in both regions.
3. **Redundant Lambda Processing:**
   - Deploy identical Lambda functions in both regions.
4. **Testing Failover:**
   - Regularly test failover scenarios to validate the configuration.
