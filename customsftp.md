Here’s a refined message including reasons why downloading the latest *n* files directly via the SFTP protocol is challenging, especially when only using SSH sessions without a scripting environment:

"I checked with my team and the Architect, and it looks like implementing a custom requirement and logic to download the latest *n* files directly using the SFTP protocol would be challenging. The primary reasons are:

1. **Limited Command Capabilities in SFTP** – Unlike a full shell environment, SFTP does not provide native support for listing files with timestamps in a way that allows filtering and selecting the latest *n* files dynamically.

2. **Lack of Sorting & Conditional Execution** – While SFTP allows listing files (`ls -lt` may not be available in all SFTP implementations), it does not support sorting and extracting the latest *n* files directly. You typically need a scripting environment to process this list.

3. **No In-Built Date-Based Selection** – SFTP does not have a built-in mechanism to filter files based on their modification time dynamically, requiring additional logic that is not feasible within standard SFTP commands.

4. **SSH Without a Scripting Environment** – If the SSH session does not allow executing scripts (e.g., Python, Bash), then processing file lists and automating downloads based on timestamps cannot be done efficiently.

5. **Workarounds Often Require External Tools** – To achieve this, a script running on a client machine (outside of SFTP) is typically needed to fetch file listings, process them, and then request only the latest *n* files.

Given these challenges, we may need to explore alternative approaches. Let’s discuss potential solutions that align with our constraints and requirements."
