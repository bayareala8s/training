Automating Resource Creation Using JSON with Terraform
Yes, you can automate the creation of resources using JSON configuration files in Terraform. Terraform natively supports JSON input through:

✅ jsondecode() function for dynamic data parsing
✅ for_each and dynamic blocks to iterate over JSON-defined resources
✅ Data sources to pull JSON files from S3 or local paths for automation


Terraform Reads JSON Data dynamically.
Terraform creates resources dynamically based on the JSON data.
CloudWatch Alarms, SNS Notifications, and other components are provisioned as needed.


Key Benefits of This Approach
✅ Highly scalable with for_each to manage multiple configurations
✅ JSON schema ensures consistency across environments
✅ Centralized JSON files simplify customer onboarding
✅ Reduces manual Terraform changes — just update the JSON file
