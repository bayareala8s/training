Hi [Team / All],

I've completed the architecture design, networking components, security controls, and a comprehensive summary for the production-grade log streaming solution from Appian Cloud to AWS (leveraging Fargate, Kinesis, Firehose, and S3).

This design is aligned with AWS best practices and addresses key pillars required for ARC review — including scalability, reliability, security, and observability.

We are ready to present this to the ARC team for approval.
Kindly review the attached materials and share any feedback or suggestions.

Additionally, I’m happy to build a POC using Terraform to validate the approach — this would likely require half a sprint to complete and test end-to-end.
