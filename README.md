Automating Resource Creation Using JSON with Terraform
Yes, you can automate the creation of resources using JSON configuration files in Terraform. Terraform natively supports JSON input through:

✅ jsondecode() function for dynamic data parsing
✅ for_each and dynamic blocks to iterate over JSON-defined resources
✅ Data sources to pull JSON files from S3 or local paths for automation


Terraform Reads JSON Data dynamically.
Terraform creates resources dynamically based on the JSON data.
CloudWatch Alarms, SNS Notifications, and other components are provisioned as needed.


Key Benefits of This Approach
✅ Highly scalable with for_each to manage multiple configurations
✅ JSON schema ensures consistency across environments
✅ Centralized JSON files simplify customer onboarding
✅ Reduces manual Terraform changes — just update the JSON file

Future Enhancements
✅ Add support for AWS Step Functions to orchestrate complex multi-step workflows
✅ Implement S3 Event Triggers to auto-trigger workflows on JSON uploads
✅ Introduce retry logic in Lambda for transient issues
✅ Develop a GUI Interface for non-technical users to submit JSON configurations easily


Architecture Overview
Step 1: Customer submits a JSON configuration for their file transfer request.
Step 2: AWS Lambda writes the request details to DynamoDB with a unique request ID.
Step 3: The system updates the request status during different stages (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed, or Failed).
Step 4: Customers query the status via an API Gateway endpoint.
Step 5: SNS sends status notifications for completed/failed requests.
