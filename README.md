Here’s the updated Teams message incorporating the AI bot’s potential to support NIS FAQs and onboarding:

Hi \[VP's Name] and \[AVP's Name],
Thank you so much for your time and the valuable inputs during our recent discussion — truly appreciated.

I’m excited to share that we’ve put together a small POC for the **FileTeam AI bot** to streamline and automate customer onboarding. I believe we can extend this further across NIS for broader impact.

Some potential use cases include:

* **Customer Self-Serve File Transfer Setup** (SFTP/S3, including multi-env provisioning)
* **Automated Incident Ticket Creation** (e.g., CloudWatch alert → bot → ServiceNow ticket with logs attached)
* **Onboarding Workflow Validation & Approval Flows** (auto-validate JSON configs, notify stakeholders, trigger Terraform pipelines)
* **Real-time Status Inquiries & Audit Summaries** (e.g., “what’s the current status of XYZ transfer?”)
* **AI-Powered NIS FAQ Assistant** to instantly answer common questions from customers or internal users
* **AI-Assisted Customer Onboarding for NIS Services**, guiding users step-by-step through the process

Looking forward to your feedback and next steps!

Best regards,
Himanshu
