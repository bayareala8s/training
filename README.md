For an **Architecture Review Committee (ARC) review**, you should prepare your solution across the **AWS Well-Architected Framework’s 6 pillars** — these are the industry-standard categories used to evaluate architectural quality, especially in enterprise and production environments.

---

## **1. Operational Excellence**
Focus on running and monitoring systems effectively and improving processes.

### Key Topics:
- **Logging & Monitoring**: CloudWatch Logs, Alarms, X-Ray (if applicable)
- **Automation**: Terraform/IaC, CI/CD for container builds and ECS deploys
- **Runbooks/Playbooks**: Document failover, patching, scaling
- **Health Checks**: ECS task health, NLB listener health, delivery success metrics
- **Recovery Procedures**: Auto-restart ECS tasks, Firehose fallback, log replay from Kinesis

---

## **2. Security**
Protect systems and data while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### Key Topics:
- **IAM Roles/Policies**: Least privilege across ECS, Kinesis, S3
- **Encryption**: At-rest (S3, Kinesis), in-transit (HTTPS, VPC endpoints)
- **Network Security**: Private subnets, NLB access control, VPC endpoints
- **Logging and Auditing**: CloudTrail, VPC flow logs, ECS logs
- **Vulnerability Management**: ECR image scanning, patching base images

---

## **3. Reliability**
Ensure the architecture recovers from failures and meets SLAs.

### Key Topics:
- **Multi-AZ Deployments**: NLB, ECS, and subnets across AZs
- **ECS Auto-Recovery**: Service scheduler auto-replaces failed tasks
- **Retry Logic**: Kinesis producer and Firehose built-in retries
- **Durable Buffers**: Kinesis stream acts as resilient buffer between ingestion and delivery
- **Failover Plans**: Backup buckets, alternate destinations (if Firehose fails)

---

## **4. Performance Efficiency**
Use resources efficiently to meet system requirements as demand changes.

### Key Topics:
- **Scalable Ingestion**: ECS Fargate scales by desired count; Kinesis by shards
- **Firehose Buffer Tuning**: Adjust size/interval for batch delivery
- **Partition Key Strategy**: Tune partitioning to avoid hot shards in Kinesis
- **Asynchronous Decoupling**: Kinesis streams decouple ingress from delivery
- **Benchmarking**: Test max sustained ingestion (Appian volume expected)

---

## **5. Cost Optimization**
Avoid unnecessary costs by using the right services, settings, and scaling strategies.

### Key Topics:
- **Fargate Pay-per-Use**: No EC2 management costs, billed by task duration
- **Buffering Firehose**: Larger batch sizes reduce S3 PUT request costs
- **Lifecycle Policies**: S3 log expiration after 30/60/90 days
- **VPC Endpoints**: Reduce NAT Gateway egress costs
- **Use of Serverless**: No need for persistent EC2 or Kafka clusters

---

## **6. Sustainability** *(Newer pillar, optional for ARC depending on org)*
Improve the environmental impact of running workloads.

### Key Topics:
- **Serverless Adoption**: Fargate, Kinesis, Firehose are shared-resource managed services
- **Optimized Containers**: Use minimal base images to reduce resource consumption
- **Right-sizing**: ECS CPU/memory limits tuned to expected traffic
- **S3 Storage Classes**: Transition to Infrequent Access or Glacier after N days

---

## Bonus: Presentation Tip for ARC Review
Prepare **slides or visuals** that map your solution to each pillar with:
- Architecture diagram
- Table of services used and why
- Summary of decisions per pillar
- Known gaps + roadmap to improve

---

Would you like me to:
- Generate a summary diagram for the 6 pillars and how your architecture addresses them?
- Provide a slide deck template with these categories?

Let me know how you'd like to present!
